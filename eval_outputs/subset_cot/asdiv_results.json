Okay, this seems like a straightforward division problem. I just need to divide the total number of pages by the number of days he took to finish the book.\n\nSo, total pages are 672, and days are 2. So, pages per day would be 672 divided by 2. Let me do that calculation.\n\n672 divided by 2.\n\nWell, 2 goes into 6 three times (2*3=6), so that's 300.\n\nThen, 2 goes into 7 three times (2*3=6), with a remainder of 1, so that's 30.\n\nFinally, 2 goes into 12 six times (2*6=12).\n\nSo, 300 plus 30 plus 6 equals 336.\n\nTherefore, Frank read 336 pages per day.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I should double-check my division.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of adding up the pages he read each day. If he read the same number of pages each day, then the sum of the pages over the two days should equal 672.\n\nSo, if he read x pages per day, then 2x = 672.\n\nSolving for x, x = 672 / 2 = 336.\n\nYeah, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of time. If two days correspond to 672 pages, then one day would correspond to half of that, which is 336 pages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the rate at which he reads. But that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can verify by multiplying. If he read 336 pages per day for 2 days, then 336 * 2 = 672, which matches the total number of pages.\n\nSo, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about it in terms of fractions. Each day he reads a fraction of the book. Since he reads the whole book in 2 days, each day he reads 1/2 of the book.\n\nSo, 1/2 of 672 is 336 pages.\n\nThat's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use proportions. If 2 days correspond to 672 pages, then 1 day corresponds to how many pages?\n\nSo, setting up a proportion: 2 days / 672 pages = 1 day / x pages.\n\nSolving for x, x = (672 * 1) / 2 = 336 pages.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about it in terms of rates. If he reads at a constant rate, then the number of pages per day is constant.\n\nSo, total pages divided by total days gives the rate.\n\nAgain, 672 pages / 2 days = 336 pages per day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that in the first day he read 336 pages, and in the second day he read the remaining 336 pages.\n\nThat would add up to 672 pages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different way to approach this problem, but I think division is the most straightforward method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider breaking down the number into smaller parts.\n\nFor example, 672 can be broken down into 600 + 72.\n\nThen, dividing each part by 2.\n\n600 / 2 = 300\n\n72 / 2 = 36\n\nThen, adding them up: 300 + 36 = 336.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use multiplication to check.\n\nIf he reads 336 pages per day for 2 days, then 336 * 2 = 672.\n\nYes, that matches the total number of pages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider that if he reads more than 336 pages on one day, he would have to read less on the other day to make up for it, but since it says he finished the book in 2 days, and assuming he read the same number of pages each day, then 336 pages per day makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me by giving too little information, but it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick involving the days, like including or excluding start and end dates, but since it's just two days, it's probably straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the book has some pages that aren't read, but the problem says he finished the book, so he", "answer": "336", "equiv": false}, {"output": "45", "answer": "45", "equiv": true}, {"output": "39", "answer": "39", "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": "5", "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's see what's going on here. There's this new cookbook that's getting popular, and the local bookstore is ordering more copies each month.

Let's look at the numbers:\n\nSeptember: 4\n\nOctober: 6\n\nNovember: 8\n\nDecember: 10\n\nHmm, it looks like each month they're ordering more copies than the previous month.

Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAnother approach: maybe there's a formula or a sequence here.\n\nLet's see, starting in September with 4 copies, and each month adding 2 more.\n\nSo, it's an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 = 4 and the common difference d = 2.\n\nThe general formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nan = a1 + (n - 1)d\n\nLet's see, if we consider September as month 1:\n\nSeptember (month 1): a1 = 4\n\nOctober (month 2): a2 = 4 + (2-1)*2 = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nNovember (month 3): a3 = 4 + (3-1)*2 = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nDecember (month 4): a4 = 4 + (4-1)*2 = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nSo, January would be month 5:\n\na5 = 4 + (5-1)*2 = 4 + 8 = 12\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier thought.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different pattern I'm missing.

Maybe it's geometric or something else.\n\nLet's check:\n\nFrom September to October: 6 / 4 = 1.5\n\nFrom October to November: 8 / 6 \u2248 1.333...\n\nFrom November to December: 10 / 8 = 1.25\n\nThe ratios are decreasing, so it's not a geometric sequence.\n\nSo, back to the arithmetic sequence idea, which seems more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of copies ordered each month is related to the month's number in the year.\n\nSeptember is the 9th month, October is the 10th, and so on.\n\nLet's see:\n\nSeptember (9): 4 copies\n\nOctober (10): 6 copies\n\nNovember (11): 8 copies\n\nDecember (12): 10 copies\n\nJanuary (13): ?\n\nIs there a relationship between the month number and the copies ordered?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nIf we plot month number vs. copies ordered:\n\n(9,4), (10,6), (11,8), (12,10)\n\nIf we look for a linear relationship, the slope would be (6-4)/(10-9) = 2/1 = 2\n\nSimilarly, (8-6)/(11-10) = 2/1 = 2\n\nAnd (10-8)/(12-11) = 2/1 = 2\n\nSo, the slope is consistently 2.\n\nSo, the linear equation would be:\n\ncopies = slope * month + intercept\n\nLet\u2019s find the intercept.\n\nUsing the point (9,4):\n\n4 = 2*9 + b\n\n4 = 18 + b\n\nb = 4 - ", "answer": "12", "equiv": false}, {"output": "5", "answer": "5", "equiv": true}, {"output": "30", "answer": "30", "equiv": true}, {"output": "96 \\text{ cm}", "answer": "96", "equiv": false}, {"output": "10", "answer": "10", "equiv": true}, {"output": "15", "answer": "15", "equiv": true}, {"output": "12", "answer": "12", "equiv": true}, {"output": "9:2", "answer": "9:2", "equiv": true}, {"output": "35", "answer": "35", "equiv": true}, {"output": "9", "answer": "9", "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": "5", "equiv": true}, {"output": "67", "answer": "67", "equiv": true}, {"output": "40^\\circ, 88^\\circ, 52^\\circ", "answer": "40", "equiv": false}, {"output": "44", "answer": "44", "equiv": true}, {"output": "12", "answer": "12", "equiv": true}, {"output": "210", "answer": "210", "equiv": true}, {"output": "32", "answer": "32", "equiv": true}, {"output": "37", "answer": "37", "equiv": true}, {"output": "136", "answer": "136", "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": "7", "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": "3", "equiv": true}, {"output": "3000", "answer": "3000", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here about Christine dividing cherries among some bowls.

Let's look at the numbers:\n\n35, 40, 45, 50, 55.\n\nHmm, it looks like each time, she's adding 5 more cherries to the next bowl.\n\nLet me check that:\n\n- From the first to the second bowl: 35 + 5 = 40\n\n- From the second to the third bowl: 40 + 5 = 45\n\n- From the third to the fourth bowl: 45 + 5 = 50\n\n- From the fourth to the fifth bowl: 50 + 5 = 55\n\nYes, each time, it's increasing by 5 cherries.\n\nSo, if this pattern continues, to find out how many cherries are in the sixth bowl, I just need to add another 5 to the fifth bowl's amount.\n\nSo, fifth bowl has 55 cherries, plus 5 more would be 60 cherries.\n\nWait, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check if there's another pattern or something more complicated going on.\n\nLet me see: is there any other way to look at this sequence?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula that describes the number of cherries in the nth bowl.\n\nLet's try to find a general formula.\n\nIf I look at the bowl numbers and the corresponding cherry counts:\n\n- Bowl 1: 35\n\n- Bowl 2: 40\n\n- Bowl 3: 45\n\n- Bowl 4: 50\n\n- Bowl 5: 55\n\nLet me see if I can express this as a linear function, like cherries = m * bowl number + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nFrom the pattern, it looks like m = 5, since it's increasing by 5 each time.\n\nNow, to find b, I can use one of the points. Let's use bowl 1:\n\n35 = 5 * 1 + b\n\n35 = 5 + b\n\nb = 30\n\nSo, the formula would be cherries = 5 * bowl number + 30\n\nLet me test this with another bowl to see if it holds.\n\nBowl 3: 5 * 3 + 30 = 15 + 30 = 45, which matches.\n\nBowl 5: 5 * 5 + 30 = 25 + 30 = 55, correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems good.\n\nNow, for the sixth bowl:\n\nCherries = 5 * 6 + 30 = 30 + 30 = 60\n\nOkay, that's consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this? Maybe using sequences or series.\n\nWell, this seems like an arithmetic sequence, where each term increases by a constant difference.\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the nth term is given by:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nWhere:\n\n- a_n is the nth term\n\n- a_1 is the first term\n\n- d is the common difference\n\n- n is the term number\n\nIn this case:\n\na_1 = 35\n\nd = 5\n\nSo, for the sixth bowl, n = 6:\n\na_6 = 35 + (6 - 1) * 5 = 35 + 5 * 5 = 35 + 25 = 60\n\nAgain, 60 cherries.\n\nAlternatively, if I look at the sequence:\n\n35, 40, 45, 50, 55, ...\n\nYes, each term is 5 more than the previous one.\n\nSo, indeed, the sixth term would be 55 + 5 = 60.\n\nI think no matter which way I approach this, the answer comes out to be 60 cherries for the sixth bowl.\n\nMaybe to be extra sure, I can plot these points.\n\nLet's consider the bowl number on the x-axis and the number of cherries on the y-axis.\n\nPoints:\n\n(1, 35), (2, ", "answer": "60", "equiv": false}, {"output": "15", "answer": "15", "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": "4", "equiv": true}, {"output": "152", "answer": "152", "equiv": true}, {"output": "10 \\text{ cents}", "answer": "10", "equiv": false}, {"output": "400", "answer": "400", "equiv": true}, {"output": "47", "answer": "47", "equiv": true}, {"output": "32 laps on Monday.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other pattern that could fit these numbers.

I need to find out the greatest number of teams that can be formed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have 14 males and 7 females, and we need to split them into teams where each team has the same number of males and the same number of females, and we can't have anyone left out. So, basically, we're looking for the largest number of teams where each team has an equal number of males and females.\n\nWait, but that might not be exactly right. The problem says \"the same combination of male students and female students.\" So, it might not necessarily mean the same number of males and females in each team, but rather each team has a certain number of males and a certain number of females, and these numbers are the same across all teams.\n\nSo, for example, if each team has 2 males and 1 female, then that's a combination, and all teams have that same combination.\n\nSo, the key here is to find the greatest number of such teams that can be formed without leaving anyone out.\n\nTo approach this, I think I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of males and females, because the GCD will tell me the largest number that can divide both 14 and 7 evenly.\n\nLet me calculate the GCD of 14 and 7.\n\nThe factors of 14 are: 1, 2, 7, 14.\n\nThe factors of 7 are: 1, 7.\n\nSo, the common factors are 1 and 7, and the greatest is 7.\n\nDoes that mean the greatest number of teams is 7?\n\nLet me check: if there are 7 teams, and each team has the same number of males and females, then each team would have 14/7 = 2 males and 7/7 = 1 female.\n\nSo, each team would have 2 males and 1 female, and there would be no one left out. That seems to fit the criteria.\n\nBut is there a way to have more than 7 teams? Let's see.\n\nIf I try 14 teams, then each team would have 14/14 = 1 male and 7/14 = 0.5 females. But I can't have half a female in a team, so that's not possible. So, 14 teams won't work.\n\nIf I try 7 teams, each with 2 males and 1 female, that works.\n\nIf I try 2 teams, each would have 7 males and 3.5 females, which again isn't possible.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 14 divided by 2 is 7 males per team, and 7 divided by 2 is 3.5 females, which isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, if I have 2 teams, each with 7 males and 3 females, but that would leave one female left out, because 7 divided by 2 is 3 with a remainder of 1. So, that doesn't work.\n\nSimilarly, if I have 3 teams, 14 divided by 3 is approximately 4.666 males, which isn't possible, and 7 divided by 3 is approximately 2.333 females, which also isn't possible.\n\nSo, it seems like 7 teams is the maximum number where each team has an integer number of males and females, with no one left out.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of ratios. The ratio of males to females is 14:7, which simplifies to 2:1. So, each team should have twice as many males as females.\n\nSo, if each team has 2 males and 1 female, then with 7 teams, I have 14 males and 7 females, which matches exactly.\n\nIf I try to have more teams, say 14 teams, then each team would need to have 1 male and 0.5 females, which isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, if I have fewer teams, like 1 team with 14 males and 7 females, that's also valid but doesn't maximize the number of teams.\n\nSo, the greatest number of teams is 7.\n\nWait, but let's think about it differently. Suppose I want to have teams with different combinations.\n\nFor example, teams with 1 male and 1 female each. Would that work?\n\nWell, if each team has 1 male and 1 female, then with 7 females, I can have 7 teams, but I have 14 males, so I would have extra males left out. But the problem says nobody left out", "answer": "7", "equiv": false}, {"output": "So I have this math problem here: \"My car gets 20 miles per gallon. How many miles can I drive on 5 gallons of gas?\" Okay, let's see. This seems like a pretty straightforward problem involving multiplication, I think.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"miles per gallon\" means. If my car gets 20 miles per gallon, that means for every gallon of gas I use, I can drive 20 miles. So, if I have 5 gallons, I should be able to drive 5 times as many miles as I could with one gallon.\n\nLet me write that down: miles = gallons \u00d7 miles per gallon.\n\nSo, miles = 5 gallons \u00d7 20 miles per gallon.\n\nNow, when I multiply 5 by 20, that gives me 100. And the units are gallons times miles per gallon. Hmm, what happens to the units? Gallons times miles per gallon should simplify to just miles, because the gallons unit cancels out.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, 5 gallons times 20 miles per gallon equals 100 miles.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to think about this? Maybe using proportions. If 1 gallon allows me to drive 20 miles, then 5 gallons should allow me to drive x miles. So, I can set up a proportion: 1 gallon / 20 miles = 5 gallons / x miles.\n\nWait, actually, that might not be the best way to set it up. Let's see, if 1 gallon corresponds to 20 miles, then 5 gallons should correspond to 5 times 20 miles, which is again 100 miles.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of division. If I have 100 miles and I divide it by 5 gallons, I should get 20 miles per gallon, which matches the given rate. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nIs there any chance I'm missing something here? Maybe considering the efficiency of the car or something like that. But the problem says the car gets exactly 20 miles per gallon, so I don't think there are any additional factors to consider.\n\nLet me consider real-world implications just to be thorough. In reality, a car's mileage can vary based on driving conditions, speed, traffic, and such. But since the problem states a constant rate of 20 miles per gallon, I should assume ideal conditions where this rate holds true.\n\nAlso, I should make sure that the units are consistent. The problem gives miles per gallon and gallons, and I need to find miles. So, the units are consistent, and I don't need to convert anything.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the tank holds exactly 5 gallons. But the problem says \"5 gallons of gas,\" so I think it's safe to assume that's the amount I have to work with.\n\nLet me think about it differently. If I plot this on a graph, with gallons on one axis and miles on the other, the slope of the line would be miles per gallon. So, with a slope of 20, for every increase of 1 gallon, miles increase by 20. Therefore, at 5 gallons, the miles would be 5 times 20, which is 100.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. This really is just a multiplication problem. 5 gallons times 20 miles per gallon equals 100 miles.\n\nLet me check if there's a formula I should be using. The general formula for distance is distance equals rate times time, but in this case, the rate is miles per gallon, and the \"time\" analog would be gallons. So, distance equals miles per gallon times gallons. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of fuel efficiency. If the car is 20 miles per gallon, that's its efficiency. So, with 5 gallons, the total distance is efficiency times fuel amount, which is again 20 times 5 equals 100 miles.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways. Unless there's some trick I'm missing, it seems like the answer is 100 miles.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if there's any remainder or something. But since 5 gallons is a whole number, and 20 miles per gallon is a whole number, there shouldn't be any remainder.\n\nAlso, just to be thorough, let's consider if the car has a full tank or not. The problem says \"on 5 gallons of gas,\" so I think it's straightforward\u2014 I have 5 gallons to use for driving.\n\nI don't think there's any need to consider starting with a full tank or anything like that, as the problem doesn't specify the tank size or anything beyond the 5 gallons.\n\nAlright, I think I've thought about this enough.

The goal is to set up as many stations as possible along the course, with each station having the same combination of water and sports drink jugs, and without any beverages left over. I need to find out the greatest number of such stations.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I have two types of jugs: water and sports drink. I need to distribute them equally among several stations without any leftovers. This sounds like a problem involving finding a common divisor of the two numbers, 16 and 12.\n\nWait, why a common divisor? Well, if I want to set up stations with the same number of each type of jug, the number of stations has to divide evenly into both the total number of water jugs and the total number of sports drink jugs.\n\nSo, I need to find the greatest number that divides both 16 and 12. That's called the greatest common divisor, or GCD, of 16 and 12.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, first, I should find the GCD of 16 and 12.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One way is to list the divisors of each number and find the largest one that's common to both.\n\nFirst, list the divisors of 16:\n\n1, 2, 4, 8, 16.\n\nNow, list the divisors of 12:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nNow, find the common divisors: 1, 2, 4.\n\nThe greatest among these is 4.\n\nSo, the GCD of 16 and 12 is 4.\n\nThat means the greatest number of stations I can set up is 4, with each station having the same number of water and sports drink jugs.\n\nBut wait, let's check if that works.\n\nIf there are 4 stations, then each station would have 16 \u00f7 4 = 4 jugs of water and 12 \u00f7 4 = 3 jugs of sports drink.\n\nThat seems fine, no leftovers.\n\nIs there a way to set up more than 4 stations? Let's see.\n\nIf I try 5 stations, then each station would have 16 \u00f7 5 = 3.2 jugs of water, which isn't possible because I can't have a fraction of a jug. Similarly, 12 \u00f7 5 = 2.4 jugs of sports drink, which also isn't possible.\n\nOkay, so 4 is indeed the maximum number of stations I can set up with whole jugs.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the ratio of water to sports drink jugs at each station.\n\nIf each station has to have the same combination of jugs, then the ratio of water to sports drink jugs should be the same at each station.\n\nThe ratio is 16:12, which simplifies to 4:3.\n\nSo, each station should have 4 jugs of water and 3 jugs of sports drink.\n\nThen, the number of stations would be the number of such combinations possible.\n\nGiven that, the number of stations is equal to the number of these 4:3 combinations that can be made from 16 water and 12 sports drink jugs.\n\nSo, 16 \u00f7 4 = 4 stations, and 12 \u00f7 3 = 4 stations.\n\nBoth give me 4 stations, which confirms the earlier result.\n\nIs there another way to look at this?\n\nMaybe using prime factorization to find the GCD.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nThe prime factorization of 16 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 2^4.\n\nThe prime factorization of 12 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 2^2 \u00d7 3.\n\nThe GCD is the product of the lowest powers of the common prime factors.\n\nHere, the common prime factor is 2, and the lowest power is 2^2 = 4.\n\nAgain, I get GCD = 4.\n\nSo, regardless of the method, I end up with 4 as the greatest number of stations.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other constraint I might have missed.\n\nThe problem says \"the same combination of jugs of water and jugs of sports drink at each station, with no beverages left over.\"\n\nI've interpreted that to mean each station has the same number of water jugs and the same number of sports drink jugs, and all jugs are used up.\n\nIs there another interpretation?\n\nWait, maybe \"the same combination\" could refer to the ratio, not necessarily the exact number.\n\nBut in that case", "answer": "4", "equiv": false}, {"output": "164", "answer": "164", "equiv": true}, {"output": "262", "answer": "262", "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": "6", "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": "1", "equiv": true}, {"output": "90", "answer": "90", "equiv": true}, {"output": "15", "answer": "15", "equiv": true}, {"output": "114", "answer": "114", "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": "6", "equiv": true}, {"output": "68", "answer": "68", "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

Martha already has some packs of pencils and pens, and she wants the total number of pencils to equal the total number of pens. But she can buy more pens to make this happen. We need to find the smallest number of additional pens she needs to buy.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says she is buying 18 packs of pencils and 14 packs of pens from the store. It seems like she is purchasing these packs, not that she already has them. So, she is going to buy these packs, and she wants the total number of pencils to equal the total number of pens. But it's a bit confusing because it says \"purchase the same number of pencils as pens.\" Does that mean the total number of pencils and pens she ends up with should be equal, or that the number she purchases should be equal?\n\nI think it means that the total number of pencils and pens she ends up with should be equal. So, she's buying these packs, and after buying, she wants the total number of pencils to equal the total number of pens.\n\nBut then it says, \"what is the smallest number of pens that she can buy.\" So, perhaps she can buy more packs of pens to make the total number of pens equal to the total number of pencils.\n\nWait, but she's already buying 14 packs of pens and 18 packs of pencils. If she wants the total number of pencils to equal the total number of pens, and she can buy more packs of pens to achieve that, then we need to find the smallest number of additional packs of pens she needs to buy.\n\nBut the problem says \"the smallest number of pens that she can buy.\" Pens are sold in packs, so we need to consider how many packs she needs to buy, and how many pens are in each pack.\n\nWait a minute, the problem doesn't specify how many pencils are in each pack of pencils or how many pens are in each pack of pens. Hmm, that's strange. Maybe it's assumed that each pack contains the same number of writing instruments.\n\nBut no, generally, packs of pencils and packs of pens might contain different numbers. For example, maybe a pack of pencils has 10 pencils, and a pack of pens has 12 pens, but since it's not specified, we need to assume something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of pencils per pack and pens per pack is the same. But again, it's not specified.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the packs are standardized, and each pack, whether pencils or pens, contains the same number of items.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total number of pencils would be 18 times the number per pack, and the total number of pens would be 14 times the number per pack.\n\nLet's denote the number of pens per pack as p. Then, the total number of pencils is 18p, and the total number of pens is 14p.\n\nBut she wants the total number of pencils to equal the total number of pens, which would only happen if 18p = 14p, but that only holds if p=0, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I need to consider that she can buy additional packs of pens to make the total number of pens equal to the total number of pencils.\n\nSo, she's buying 18 packs of pencils and 14 packs of pens. Let\u2019s say each pack contains p writing instruments. Then, she has 18p pencils and 14p pens.\n\nShe wants 18p pencils = 14p pens + additional pens.\n\nWait, but if each pack contains p pens, then additional pens would be in terms of packs. So, if she buys x more packs of pens, then the total number of pens would be 14p + x*p = (14 + x)p.\n\nShe wants this to equal the number of pencils: (14 + x)p = 18p.\n\nThen, 14 + x = 18, so x = 4.\n\nSo, she needs to buy 4 more packs of pens.\n\nBut the problem asks for the smallest number of pens that she can buy, not the number of packs.\n\nSo, if each pack contains p pens, then the smallest number of pens she can buy is 4p.\n\nBut we don't know what p is.

To do that, I need to divide 367 by 15.\n\nLet me do the division: 367 divided by 15.\n\n15 times 24 is 360, because 15 times 20 is 300, and 15 times 4 is 60, so 300 plus 60 is 360.\n\nSubtracting 360 from 367 gives a remainder of 7.\n\nSo, 367 divided by 15 is 24 with a remainder of 7. That means each necklace would have 24 beads, and there would be 7 beads left over.\n\nBut Betty wants to use all the beads to make the necklaces, with each having the same number of beads. Since she has 7 beads left over, that means she doesn't have enough beads to make all 15 necklaces with 24 beads each without having some beads left over.\n\nWait, actually, that's not quite right.

So, the company has 95 tons of oil to store, and they have two types of barrels: large ones that can hold 6 tons each and small ones that can hold 5 tons each. The goal is to use the least number of barrels possible, and make sure every barrel is fully occupied. We need to figure out how many large barrels should be used.\n\nFirst, I think I should try to maximize the use of large barrels since they have a larger capacity. That way, I can minimize the total number of barrels needed. So, if I use as many large barrels as possible, I should have fewer barrels overall.\n\nLet me see how many large barrels I can use. If I divide the total oil by the capacity of a large barrel:\n\n95 \u00f7 6 = 15.833...\n\nThat means I can use 15 large barrels, which would hold 15 \u00d7 6 = 90 tons of oil. But then I'd have 95 - 90 = 5 tons left over, which would exactly fill one small barrel. So, in this case, I'd use 15 large barrels and 1 small barrel, for a total of 16 barrels.\n\nBut is there a way to use fewer barrels? Maybe by mixing large and small barrels in a different combination.\n\nLet me consider using one less large barrel, so 14 large barrels. That would hold 14 \u00d7 6 = 84 tons. Then, I'd have 95 - 84 = 11 tons left. Since small barrels hold 5 tons each, 11 \u00f7 5 = 2.2, which means I'd need 3 small barrels to hold the remaining 11 tons, but that would leave one small barrel not fully occupied, which violates the condition that every barrel must be fully occupied. So, this option doesn't work.\n\nWhat if I use 13 large barrels? That would hold 13 \u00d7 6 = 78 tons, leaving 95 - 78 = 17 tons. 17 \u00f7 5 = 3.4, which would require 4 small barrels, but again, not all would be fully occupied. Not acceptable.\n\nLet's try 12 large barrels: 12 \u00d7 6 = 72 tons, leaving 95 - 72 = 23 tons. 23 \u00f7 5 = 4.6, so I'd need 5 small barrels, but again, not all would be full. No good.\n\nNext, 11 large barrels: 11 \u00d7 6 = 66 tons, leaving 95 - 66 = 29 tons. 29 \u00f7 5 = 5.8, so 6 small barrels, but not all full. Not acceptable.\n\n10 large barrels: 10 \u00d7 6 = 60 tons, leaving 95 - 60 = 35 tons. 35 \u00f7 5 = 7, so 7 small barrels, all full. That would be a total of 10 + 7 = 17 barrels. That's more than the earlier 15 large and 1 small barrel option, which gave me 16 barrels.\n\nWait a minute, that's worse than my initial option. So, going down from 15 large barrels, I get to 10 large barrels with more total barrels. That suggests that 15 large barrels and 1 small barrel is better.\n\nBut maybe there's a better combination. Let's try using fewer large barrels and more small barrels.\n\nWhat if I use 14 large barrels, which hold 84 tons, and then need to fill 11 tons. But as before, that doesn't work because 11 isn't a multiple of 5.\n\nWhat about 13 large barrels? 78 tons, leaving 17 tons, which isn't a multiple of 5.\n\n12 large barrels: 72 tons, leaving 23 tons, which isn't a multiple of 5.\n\n11 large barrels: 66 tons, leaving 29 tons, which isn't a multiple of 5.\n\n10 large barrels: 60 tons, leaving 35 tons, which is exactly 7 small barrels.

Mr. Johnson wants to arrange all of the students in equal rows, with each row containing only boys or only girls. I need to find the greatest number of students that can be in each row.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. So, we have two groups: boys and girls, with 72 and 90 respectively. We need to arrange them into rows where each row is either all boys or all girls, and all rows have the same number of students.\n\nI think the key here is to find a number that divides both 72 and 90 evenly, because each row needs to have the same number of students, and they can't be mixed (only boys or only girls in each row).\n\nSo, I need to find a common divisor of 72 and 90, and among all the common divisors, I need to find the greatest one because the problem is asking for the greatest number of students per row.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I understand this correctly. If I find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 90, that should give me the largest number that divides both 72 and 90 without leaving a remainder. That sounds like exactly what I need.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One way is to list all the divisors of each number and find the largest one that appears in both lists.\n\nFirst, let's list the divisors of 72.\n\n72 can be divided by: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72.\n\nNow, let's list the divisors of 90.\n\n90 can be divided by: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90.\n\nNow, looking at both lists, the common divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18.\n\nAmong these, the greatest one is 18.\n\nSo, the greatest number of students that can be in each row is 18.\n\nLet me double-check this to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIf each row has 18 students, then the number of rows for boys would be 72 divided by 18, which is 4 rows. For girls, 90 divided by 18 is 5 rows. That seems to work, and 18 is indeed the largest number that divides both 72 and 90.\n\nWait a minute, is there a larger number that divides both? Let's see, maybe 20? But 20 doesn't divide 72 evenly, because 72 divided by 20 is 3.6, which isn't a whole number. So, 20 wouldn't work.\n\nWhat about 15? 72 divided by 15 is 4.8, which again isn't a whole number. So, 15 doesn't work either.\n\nHow about 12? 72 divided by 12 is 6, and 90 divided by 12 is 7.5, which isn't a whole number. So, 12 doesn't work for girls.\n\n9? 72 divided by 9 is 8, and 90 divided by 9 is 10. That works, but 9 is smaller than 18.\n\n6? 72 divided by 6 is 12, and 90 divided by 6 is 15. That works, but again, it's smaller than 18.\n\n3? 72 divided by 3 is 24, and 90 divided by 3 is 30.\n\n2? 72 divided by 2 is 36, and 90 divided by 2 is 45.\n\n1? That's 72 and 90 respectively, but that's the trivial case.\n\nSo, indeed, 18 is the greatest number that divides both 72 and 90 evenly.\n\nAnother way to find the GCD is to use prime factorization.\n\nLet's factorize 72 and 90 into their prime factors.\n\n72 can be broken down as follows:\n\n72 divided by 2 is 36,\n\n36 divided by 2 is 18,\n\n18 divided by 2 is 9,\n\n9 divided by 3 is 3,\n\n3 divided by 3 is 1.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 72 are 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7", "answer": "18", "equiv": false}, {"output": "10.30", "answer": "10.3", "equiv": true}, {"output": "11", "answer": "11", "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": "8", "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": "7", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this problem here.

And she wants to create the greatest number of teams possible. I need to find out how many boys will be on each team.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, she has 25 girls and 35 boys. She wants to divide them into teams where each team has the same number of girls and the same number of boys. And she wants the greatest number of teams possible.\n\nFirst, I need to find a way to divide both the girls and the boys into teams where each team has the same number of each. That means that the number of girls per team has to be a divisor of 25, and the number of boys per team has to be a divisor of 35.\n\nBut wait, actually, it's not just any divisor because she wants the same number of girls and boys on each team, and the greatest number of teams possible.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should think about the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of girls and boys. The GCD would give me the largest number that divides both 25 and 35, which could help in dividing them into teams.\n\nLet me check the GCD of 25 and 35.\n\nThe factors of 25 are 1, 5, 25.\n\nThe factors of 35 are 1, 5, 7, 35.\n\nThe common factors are 1 and 5, so the GCD is 5.\n\nSo, the greatest number of teams she can create is 5.\n\nNow, if she creates 5 teams, then each team should have the same number of girls and the same number of boys.\n\nSo, the number of girls per team would be total girls divided by the number of teams, which is 25 divided by 5, which is 5 girls per team.\n\nSimilarly, the number of boys per team would be total boys divided by the number of teams, which is 35 divided by 5, which is 7 boys per team.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for how many boys will be on each team. So, according to this, it would be 7 boys per team.\n\nBut let me double-check if this is indeed the greatest number of teams possible.\n\nIf I try to make more than 5 teams, say 7 teams, then:\n\nNumber of girls per team would be 25 divided by 7, which is not an integer (it's approximately 3.57), which doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a girl on a team.\n\nSimilarly, if I try 7 teams, number of boys per team would be 35 divided by 7, which is 5, which is fine, but since the number of girls per team isn't an integer, it's not possible.\n\nSo, 5 teams is indeed the greatest number possible where both the number of girls and boys per team are integers.\n\nTherefore, each team has 7 boys.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this?\n\nMaybe I can think about the ratio of girls to boys per team.\n\nLet's say each team has G girls and B boys.\n\nThen, the total number of teams T would be equal to 25/G (since total girls divided by girls per team) and also equal to 35/B (since total boys divided by boys per team).\n\nSo, 25/G = 35/B = T.\n\nSo, T is the number of teams, and it must be an integer.\n\nAlso, G and B must be integers because you can't have fractional students.\n\nSo, G must be a divisor of 25, and B must be a divisor of 35.\n\nMoreover, since T = 25/G and T = 35/B, then G = 25/T and B = 35/T.\n\nSince G and B must be integers, T must be a common divisor of 25 and 35.\n\nWe already found that the GCD of 25 and 35 is 5, and the common divisors are 1 and 5.\n\nSo, possible values for T are 1 and 5.\n\nThe greatest number of teams is 5.\n\nTherefore, B = 35/5 = 7 boys per team.\n\nAlternatively, if T=1, then B=35, which means only one team with 35 boys and 25 girls.\n\nBut the problem specifies to create the greatest number of teams possible, which is 5.\n\nHence, each team has 7 boys.\n\nLet me see if there's another approach, maybe using the least common multiple (LCM).\n\nWait, I don't think L", "answer": "7", "equiv": false}, {"output": "76", "answer": "76", "equiv": true}, {"output": "43", "answer": "43", "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": "5", "equiv": true}, {"output": "97", "answer": "97", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this problem here: Bobby has 142 books, and Kristi has 78 books. I need to find out what the difference is between the number of Bobby's books and Kristi's books. Okay, that sounds straightforward. I think I need to subtract the smaller number from the larger one to find the difference.\n\nSo, Bobby has 142 books, and Kristi has 78 books. To find the difference, I should do 142 minus 78. Let me write that down: 142 - 78.\n\nNow, how do I do this subtraction? I can probably do it mentally, but maybe I should show it step by step to make sure I understand it fully.\n\nLet me break it down. Starting from the rightmost digit, which is the ones place: 2 minus 8. Hmm, 2 is less than 8, so I need to borrow from the tens place.\n\nThe number 142 has a 4 in the tens place. If I borrow 1 from the tens place, the 4 becomes 3, and the 2 in the ones place becomes 12. Now, 12 minus 8 is 4.\n\nNext, moving to the tens place: 3 minus 7. Again, 3 is less than 7, so I need to borrow from the hundreds place.\n\nThe number 142 has a 1 in the hundreds place. If I borrow 1 from the hundreds place, the 1 becomes 0, and the 3 in the tens place becomes 13. Now, 13 minus 7 is 6.\n\nFinally, moving to the hundreds place: 0 minus 0 is 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 142 minus 78 is 64.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to check this? Maybe I can add 78 and 64 to see if I get 142.\n\nLet's try that: 78 plus 64.\n\nAdding the ones place: 8 plus 4 is 12. Write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nAdding the tens place: 7 plus 6 is 13, plus the carried over 1 makes 14. Write down 4, carry over 1.\n\nAdding the hundreds place: 0 plus 0 is 0, plus the carried over 1 makes 1.\n\nSo, 78 plus 64 is 142. That matches the original number of Bobby's books. So, my subtraction was correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use mental math to verify this. Starting from 78, how many do I need to add to get to 142?\n\nFirst, from 78 to 100 is 22.\n\nThen, from 100 to 142 is 42.\n\nSo, total addition is 22 plus 42, which is 64.\n\nThat matches my previous result. So, the difference is indeed 64 books.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using algebra or some other method, but I think subtraction is the most straightforward way here.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can try subtracting 78 from 142 again, but this time without borrowing.\n\nWait, but borrowing is necessary because we have smaller digits in the minuend compared to the subtrahend in both the ones and tens places.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of place value.\n\nBreaking down 142: it's 1 hundred, 4 tens, and 2 ones.\n\nBreaking down 78: it's 7 tens and 8 ones.\n\nSo, 1 hundred minus 0 hundreds is 1 hundred.\n\n4 tens minus 7 tens: well, that's negative 3 tens, but I can't have negative tens, so I need to adjust.\n\nMaybe it's better to stick with the borrowing method I used earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of 142 as 100 + 40 + 2, and 78 as 70 + 8.\n\nThen, subtracting 70 + 8 from 100 + 40 + 2.\n\nFirst, 100 + 40 is 140, minus 70 is 70, and then 70 minus 8 is 62, but wait, that doesn't seem right because I also have the 2 from 142.\n\nHmm, maybe this method is confusing for me right now.\n\nStick to the original subtraction method: 142 - 78.\n\nBorrowing as needed, we get 64.\n\nAnd the addition check confirms it.\n\nSo, the difference in the number of books between Bobby and", "answer": "64", "equiv": false}, {"output": "42", "answer": "42", "equiv": true}, {"output": "3824", "answer": "3824", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: A pizza store had 11 pieces of pepperoni to put on their pizzas. If each pizza got 2 pieces, how many extra pieces of pepperoni would they have?\n\nAlright, let's break this down. They have 11 pieces of pepperoni in total, and each pizza gets 2 pieces. I need to find out how many extra pieces they would have after putting pepperoni on the pizzas.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many pizzas they can make with 11 pieces of pepperoni, given that each pizza gets 2 pieces. To do that, I can divide the total number of pepperoni pieces by the number of pieces per pizza.\n\nSo, 11 divided by 2. Let's see, 2 times 5 is 10, which is less than 11. If they make 5 pizzas, that would use up 10 pieces of pepperoni. Then, they'd have 11 - 10 = 1 piece left over.\n\nWait, but is there a better way to approach this? Maybe using division and finding the remainder?\n\nYes, that sounds like a good idea. When you divide 11 by 2, you get a quotient and a remainder. The quotient tells you how many whole pizzas you can make, and the remainder tells you how many extra pieces are left.\n\nSo, 11 divided by 2 is 5 with a remainder of 1. That means they can make 5 pizzas, using 10 pieces of pepperoni, and have 1 piece left over.\n\nLet me double-check that. If each pizza gets 2 pieces, and they make 5 pizzas, that's 5 * 2 = 10 pieces. Subtracting that from the total: 11 - 10 = 1 piece remaining.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of subtraction. Start with 11 pieces, subtract 2 for each pizza until I can't subtract 2 anymore.\n\nSo, start with 11:\n\n- Subtract 2 (for the first pizza): 11 - 2 = 9\n\n- Subtract 2 (for the second pizza): 9 - 2 = 7\n\n- Subtract 2 (for the third pizza): 7 - 2 = 5\n\n- Subtract 2 (for the fourth pizza): 5 - 2 = 3\n\n- Subtract 2 (for the fifth pizza): 3 - 2 = 1\n\nNow, I have 1 piece left, which is less than 2, so I can't make another pizza.\n\nSo, again, 1 extra piece of pepperoni.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using multiplication.\n\nWell, if each pizza gets 2 pieces, then the total number of pieces used is 2 times the number of pizzas. Let's say they make p pizzas, so total pieces used are 2p.\n\nThe extra pieces would be the total pieces minus the pieces used: 11 - 2p.\n\nBut I need to find the maximum number of pizzas they can make, which is when 2p is less than or equal to 11.\n\nSo, p \u2264 11 / 2, which is p \u2264 5.5.\n\nBut since they can't make half a pizza in this context, p must be 5.\n\nThen, extra pieces = 11 - 2*5 = 11 - 10 = 1.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other approach. Maybe using modulo operation, which directly gives the remainder.\n\nSo, 11 mod 2 = 1.\n\nThat directly gives the extra pieces: 1.\n\nThis is consistent with the previous methods.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's think about what would happen if they had a different number of pieces.\n\nFor example, if they had 10 pieces, and each pizza gets 2 pieces, then 10 / 2 = 5 pizzas, with 0 extra pieces.\n\nOr if they had 12 pieces, 12 / 2 = 6 pizzas, again 0 extra pieces.\n\nBut in this case, with 11 pieces, it's not divisible by 2, so there's 1 extra piece.\n\nWait, but what if the number of pieces per pizza was different? Say, each pizza gets 3 pieces.\n\nThen, 11 divided by 3 is 3 pizzas with a remainder of 2 pieces.\n\nSo, extra pieces would be 2.\n\nBut in this problem, it's specifically 2 pieces per pizza.\n\nLet me make sure I'm not overcomplicating this.\n\nThe question is straightforward: with 11 pieces and each pizza getting 2 pieces, how many extra pieces are left?\n\nFrom all the methods I've used, the answer is consistently 1.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer", "answer": "1", "equiv": false}, {"output": "Let's see.

And now, she's buying refreshments for her friends who are coming over the next day. I need to find out how much she spent on juice.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's going on with the money. She had $69.00 initially, and after buying cookies, she has $50.00 left. So, the amount she spent on cookies must be the difference between $69.00 and $50.00.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n$69.00 - $50.00 = $19.00\n\nSo, she spent $19.00 on cookies.\n\nNow, she has $50.00 left, and she's buying juice. The problem is asking how much she spent on juice. But wait, the problem says \"some refreshments,\" and specifically asks about juice. Hmm, maybe refreshments include juice and possibly other things, but the problem seems to be focusing only on juice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"refreshments\" are synonymous with juice in this context. Or perhaps juice is a part of the refreshments. But the way the problem is phrased, it seems like \"refreshments\" refer to juice.\n\nLet me read it again: \"she also bought some refreshments. If she has $50.00 left from the money she had after buying cookies, and she has $69.00 before, how much did she spend on juice?\"\n\nWait a second, it says she has $50.00 left from the money she had after buying cookies, and she had $69.00 before. So, after buying cookies, she had $50.00, and then she bought juice, and now she has some amount left, but it doesn't specify how much is left after buying juice.\n\nActually, re-reading the problem: \"she has $50.00 left from the money she had after buying cookies, and she has $69.00 before.\" This is a bit confusing. Let's break it down.\n\nIt seems like there are two points in time:\n\n1. Before buying cookies: she had $69.00.\n\n2. After buying cookies: she has $50.00 left.\n\nThen, she buys juice (or refreshments) after that, and presumably spends some of the $50.00 on juice, leaving her with less than $50.00.\n\nBut the problem is not specifying how much she has left after buying juice. It's only asking how much she spent on juice.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem says: \"she has $50.00 left from the money she had after buying cookies, and she has $69.00 before, how much did she spend on juice?\"\n\nPerhaps it's meant to be interpreted as: she had $69.00 initially, spent some on cookies, has $50.00 left, and then spent some of that $50.00 on juice, but it doesn't say how much is left after buying juice.\n\nBut the way it's worded, \"she has $50.00 left from the money she had after buying cookies,\" might imply that the $50.00 is what remains after buying cookies, before buying juice.\n\nWait, perhaps the timing is unclear. Let's try to parse the sentence carefully.\n\n\"she has $50.00 left from the money she had after buying cookies, and she has $69.00 before, how much did she spend on juice?\"\n\nIt seems like there are two amounts mentioned:\n\n- $69.00 before buying cookies.\n\n- $50.00 left after buying cookies.\n\nThen, she buys juice with some of the $50.00, and we need to find out how much she spent on juice.\n\nBut the problem is, it doesn't say how much she has left after buying juice. It only says she has $50.00 left after buying cookies, and then she bought juice, but it doesn't specify the remaining amount after buying juice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $50.00 is what she has left after both buying cookies and buying juice, and she started with $69.00.\n\nBut that would mean she spent $69.00 - $50.00 = $19.00 in total on both cookies and juice.

If they sold four of them, how many cats did they still have?\" It seems pretty straightforward, but I want to make sure I understand it completely before I dive in.\n\nFirst off, the problem mentions a pet store that had seven Siamese cats. Siamese is a breed of cat, but I don't think the breed really matters for the math here. It's just giving a bit of context. The important part is that there are seven cats to start with.\n\nThen, it says they sold four of them. So, if they had seven and sold four, I need to find out how many cats they have left.\n\nThis sounds like a simple subtraction problem. I just need to subtract the number of cats sold from the original number of cats.\n\nSo, 7 minus 4 should give me the answer.\n\nLet me write that down: 7 - 4 = ?\n\nNow, 7 minus 4 is 3.\n\nSo, the pet store still has 3 cats.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. Maybe there's something I'm missing here.\n\nThe problem is about Siamese cats specifically, but it doesn't mention any other types of cats or any additional information that might complicate things. It seems like a straightforward subtraction.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nPerhaps the problem is trying to trick me by mentioning \"Siamese\" cats, but I don't think that's the case. It's probably just to give a bit of flavor to the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a chance that the store had other types of cats, and selling four Siamese cats would affect the total number of cats in the store differently, but the problem doesn't mention any other cats. So, I should assume that only Siamese cats are being considered here.\n\nWait, but the question is about how many cats they still have, not just Siamese cats. Hmm.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"A pet store had seven Siamese cats. If they sold four of them, how many cats did they still have?\"\n\nAh, here's a potential point of confusion. The problem says \"they sold four of them.\" Does \"them\" refer only to the Siamese cats, or to cats in general?\n\nLooking back, the previous phrase is \"A pet store had seven Siamese cats.\" So, \"them\" should refer to the Siamese cats.\n\nSo, it's saying that the pet store had seven Siamese cats and sold four of them.\n\nBut the question is about how many cats they still have, not just how many Siamese cats they have left.\n\nDoes that mean that the store only had Siamese cats to begin with, or did they have other cats as well?\n\nThe problem doesn't specify, but from the wording, it seems like the store had only Siamese cats, because it says \"a pet store had seven Siamese cats.\" It doesn't mention any other types of cats.\n\nSo, if they only had seven Siamese cats and sold four of them, then they would have three cats left in total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the store had other cats besides the Siamese ones, but the problem doesn't provide any information about that. In the absence of such information, I think it's safe to assume that the store only had Siamese cats.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 3.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider another angle.\n\nSuppose the store had other cats besides the Siamese ones. Let's say they had, for example, five Persian cats in addition to the seven Siamese cats. Then, the total number of cats would be 12.\n\nIf they sold four Siamese cats, then they would have 3 Siamese cats and 5 Persian cats left, totaling 8 cats.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't mention any other types of cats, I can't assume that.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that the store had only seven Siamese cats to begin with, sold four of them, and now has three cats left.\n\nSo, the answer is 3.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider if the four cats sold were all Siamese. The problem says \"four of them,\" referring to the seven Siamese cats they had.\n\nSo, \"them\" probably refers to the Siamese cats.\n\nTherefore, selling four Siamese cats would leave them with three Siamese cats.\n\nBut the question is about how many cats they still have, not just Siamese cats.\n\nIf they only had Siamese cats to begin with, then selling four would leave them with three cats in total.\n\nBut if they had other cats, then the total would be different.\n\nSince the problem doesn't specify, I'll stick with the assumption that they only", "answer": "3", "equiv": false}, {"output": "29", "answer": "29", "equiv": true}, {"output": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says that crackers come in packages of 18, and Betty ate 45 crackers. I need to find out how many crackers she has left.

I need to find out how many crackers are left after she's eaten those 45.\n\nWait a minute, the problem doesn't specify how many packages of crackers Betty started with. It only says that crackers come in packages of 18 and that she ate 45 of them. So, I need to figure out the total number of crackers she started with and then subtract the 45 she ate.\n\nBut how do I know the total number of crackers she started with? The problem doesn't say. Maybe I can assume she started with a certain number of packages. Let's think about this.\n\nIf crackers come in packages of 18, and she ate 45, I need to find out how many packages that would cover. Maybe she had multiple packages.\n\nLet me try to calculate how many packages of 18 would give her at least 45 crackers.\n\nSo, one package is 18 crackers.\n\nTwo packages would be 18 times 2, which is 36.\n\nThree packages would be 18 times 3, which is 54.\n\nSo, 54 is more than 45, which means she must have had at least three packages to have enough crackers to eat 45.\n\nWait, but maybe she had more than three packages. Let's see.\n\nIf she had three packages, that's 54 crackers. If she ate 45, then the number left would be 54 minus 45, which is 9.\n\nBut is that the only possibility? Maybe she had more packages.\n\nFor example, if she had four packages, that would be 18 times 4, which is 72 crackers. If she ate 45, then she would have 72 minus 45, which is 27 left.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how many packages she started with, so assuming she only had three packages might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider only the packages she has after eating the 45 crackers.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Crackers come in packages of 18. Betty ate 45 crackers. How many crackers does she have left?\"\n\nHmm, it doesn't specify how many packages she started with or anything like that. Maybe it's assuming that she only had the packages she has left after eating the 45 crackers.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense. Let's think differently.\n\nPerhaps the problem is about finding the remainder after eating 45 crackers from a certain number of packages.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of total crackers minus the eaten ones equals the left ones.\n\nBut without knowing the total, I can't find the exact number left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find out how many full packages are left after she ate 45 crackers.\n\nBut again, without knowing the initial number of packages, that's hard to determine.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find the remainder of crackers in terms of full packages.\n\nLet's see, if each package has 18 crackers, and she ate 45, I can find out how many full packages that corresponds to.\n\nSo, 45 divided by 18 is 2.5 packages. But since packages are whole, she must have opened 3 packages to eat 45 crackers, because 2 packages are 36 crackers, and she ate 45, which is 9 more than 36. So, she must have opened a third package.\n\nTherefore, if she opened 3 packages, that's 54 crackers total. She ate 45, so she has 54 - 45 = 9 crackers left.\n\nBut, maybe she had more than 3 packages to start with. For example, if she had 4 packages, that's 72 crackers. She eats 45, leaving 27 crackers.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the initial number of packages, so assuming she only had 3 packages might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that she had only the exact number of packages needed for the 45 crackers she ate.\n\nBut 45 is not a multiple of 18, so she must have had more than two packages, since 2 packages are 36 crackers, which is less than 45.\n\nWait, but if she only had two packages, that's 36 crackers, and she ate 45, which is not", "answer": "9", "equiv": false}, {"output": "42", "answer": "42", "equiv": true}, {"output": "16", "answer": "16", "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": "7", "equiv": true}, {"output": "19", "answer": "19", "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Jose is on a bus, and he notices some people sitting. Then, at the next bus stop, 5 people get on and 2 people get off. Two stops later, 7 people get on and 15 people get off at the terminal station. We need to find out how many people were on the bus when Jose got on.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's happening here. We have a bus with some initial number of people, including Jose. At each bus stop, people get on and off the bus. We need to work backwards or forwards through these events to find the initial number of people.\n\nLet's denote the number of people on the bus when Jose got on as X. This includes Jose himself, so the number of other people sitting is X - 1.\n\nNow, at the next bus stop, 5 people get on and 2 people get off. So, the new number of people on the bus is:\n\nX + 5 - 2 = X + 3\n\nTwo stops later, 7 people get on and 15 people get off at the terminal station. So, the final number of people on the bus is:\n\n(X + 3) + 7 - 15 = X + 10 - 15 = X - 5\n\nNow, since this is the terminal station, presumably the bus is empty after this stop, meaning that all remaining passengers get off. So, the final number of people on the bus is 0.\n\nTherefore, we can set up the equation:\n\nX - 5 = 0\n\nSolving for X:\n\nX = 5\n\nSo, there were 5 people on the bus when Jose got on.\n\nBut wait a minute, let's double-check this. Maybe there's something I'm missing. Let's go through the events again.\n\nInitial number of people: X\n\nAfter the first stop: X + 5 - 2 = X + 3\n\nAfter the second stop: X + 3 + 7 - 15 = X + 10 - 15 = X - 5\n\nAnd the bus is empty after the terminal stop, so X - 5 = 0, which gives X = 5.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But maybe I should consider if Jose got off at the terminal station or not. The problem says \"when Jose rode on a bus,\" but it doesn't specify if he got off at the terminal or not.\n\nIf Jose was still on the bus at the terminal station, then the final number of people would include him, and if he got off, then he would be among the 15 people getting off.\n\nWait, that's a good point. The problem doesn't specify when Jose got off. Maybe he got off at the terminal station.\n\nIf Jose got off at the terminal station, then he would be among the 15 people getting off. So, the initial number of people would be X, and after all the stops, including the terminal, the bus is empty.\n\nBut let's think about it differently. Let's assume that Jose was still on the bus at the terminal station.\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"when Jose rode on a bus,\" but it doesn't specify his getting off point. To avoid confusion, maybe it's safer to assume that Jose got off at some earlier stop or is not on the bus at the terminal stop.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Jose is still on the bus at the terminal stop.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.

Let's consider the total number of people who got on and off the bus.\n\nTotal people got on: 5 + 7 = 12\n\nTotal people got off: 2 + 15 = 17\n\nSo, the net change is 12 - 17 = -5\n\nSince the bus is empty at the end, the initial number of people must have been 5 to account for the -5 net change.\n\nTherefore, X = 5\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that Jose was on", "answer": "5", "equiv": false}, {"output": "2", "answer": "2", "equiv": true}, {"output": "120", "answer": "120", "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": "1", "equiv": true}, {"output": "78", "answer": "78", "equiv": true}, {"output": "210", "answer": "210", "equiv": true}, {"output": "34", "answer": "34", "equiv": true}, {"output": "80.85", "answer": "80.85", "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. So, the problem says that a clown gave away six balloons and now has fifty-five balloons left. We need to find out how many balloons he had to start with.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The clown gave away some balloons and now has some left. I need to find the original number of balloons he had before giving any away.\n\nLet me think about this. If he gave away six balloons and has fifty-five left, that means the original number of balloons is the sum of the ones he gave away and the ones he has left.\n\nSo, original number of balloons = balloons given away + balloons left.\n\nIn numbers, that would be: original number = 6 + 55.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIs there any other information in the problem that I need to consider? The problem says \"six balloons\" and \"fifty-five balloons left.\" That's all the information given, so I think the calculation I mentioned is correct.\n\nLet me double-check. If he had, say, 61 balloons and gave away 6, he would have 55 left. Because 61 minus 6 equals 55.\n\nWait, but according to my earlier equation, original number = 6 + 55 = 61. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation to represent the situation. Let\u2019s denote the original number of balloons as x.\n\nThen, x - 6 = 55.\n\nBecause he gave away six balloons and had fifty-five left.\n\nNow, to find x, I can add 6 to both sides of the equation:\n\nx - 6 + 6 = 55 + 6,\n\nwhich simplifies to x = 61.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nIs there another way to look at this problem? Maybe using multiplication or division, but that doesn't seem necessary here because it's a straightforward addition problem.\n\nLet me consider if there's any possibility that the balloons given away or left could be negative, but that doesn't make sense in this context. You can't give away negative balloons, and having a negative number of balloons left wouldn't make sense in reality.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the units are consistent: all quantities are in terms of balloons, so no need to convert units.\n\nFurthermore, checking if the answer is reasonable: starting with 61 balloons, giving away 6, leaves 55. That seems correct.\n\nLet me try another approach. If I imagine the clown having a certain number of balloons, and he gives away 6, and has 55 left, then to find the original amount, I need to reverse the action of giving away 6. So, reversing subtraction means adding back the 6 that was given away.\n\nTherefore, 55 + 6 = 61.\n\nAgain, this confirms my previous calculations.\n\nIs there any chance that the problem is more complex than it seems? For example, maybe some balloons were lost or popped, but the problem doesn't mention that. It only mentions that six balloons were given away and fifty-five are left.\n\nSo, I should stick with the information provided and not assume any additional circumstances.\n\nLet me also consider if the numbers given are accurate. Fifty-five is a specific number, and six is a small number, so adding them together should be straightforward.\n\nPerforming the addition: 50 + 6 = 56, and then adding the remaining 5, which makes 61.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of money. If someone had some money, spent $6, and had $55 left, how much did they have originally? It's the same concept: original amount = amount spent + amount left, which is $6 + $55 = $61.\n\nThis analogy helps confirm that my approach is correct.\n\nMoreover, I can think about the problem in terms of a number line. Starting from zero, if the clown had x balloons, gave away six to reach fifty-five, then x would be six steps before fifty-five on the number line. So, moving six steps back from fifty-five brings us to sixty-one.\n\nAgain, this confirms that the original number of balloons is sixty-one.\n\nLet me also consider if there is any possibility of misinterpreting the problem. For example, maybe the sixty balloons were given away in sets or something, but no, the problem says \"six balloons\" as a total given away.\n\nAlso, ensuring that \"fifty-five balloons left\" means exactly that, no more, no less.\n\nAdditionally, considering if the problem involves any fractions or decimals, but no, everything is in whole numbers.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the answer is sixty-one.\n\nTo present the final answer, as instructed, I should box it.\n\n\\boxed{61}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{6", "answer": "61", "equiv": false}, {"output": "35", "answer": "35", "equiv": true}, {"output": "294", "answer": "42", "equiv": false}, {"output": "67", "answer": "67", "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

But let's dig deeper to make sure that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's really being asked here. The problem is about baking cookies, and it gives me the time it takes to bake one pan. It wants to know how long it will take to bake four pans. Assuming that I can only bake one pan at a time, then yes, multiplying 7 minutes by 4 pans would give me 28 minutes. However, I should consider if there's any overlapping or simultaneous baking that could affect the total time.\n\nLet me think about real-life scenarios. In a home oven, you might be able to fit more than one pan at a time. But the problem doesn't specify how many pans can fit in the oven simultaneously. It only says it takes 7 minutes to bake one pan. So, perhaps it's safe to assume that I can only bake one pan at a time. In that case, 7 minutes per pan for 4 pans would indeed be 28 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's another way to look at this. Perhaps the oven can handle multiple pans at once, but the baking time remains the same regardless of the number of pans, as long as they fit. But again, the problem doesn't provide information about the oven's capacity. So, sticking to the information given, which is that it takes 7 minutes to bake one pan, and without any additional context, the most logical approach is to assume that each pan takes 7 minutes individually.\n\nAnother angle to consider: is there any preparation time before baking or any cooling time after baking that might affect the total time? The problem doesn't mention any setup time or cooling periods, so I shouldn't factor those in. It's purely about the baking time.\n\nLet me also consider if there's any overlapping of tasks. For example, if I could start baking another pan as soon as one is done, but that would require having multiple pans in the oven at the same time, which again brings us back to the oven's capacity.\n\nSince the problem is straightforward and doesn't provide additional details, I'll proceed with the initial approach.\n\nSo, time to bake one pan: 7 minutes.\n\nNumber of pans: 4.\n\nTotal time: 7 minutes/pans \u00d7 4 pans = 28 minutes.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a more efficient way if the oven can handle multiple pans. Let's explore that possibility.\n\nSuppose the oven can fit two pans at a time. Then, I could bake two pans together in 7 minutes. So, for four pans, I would need two batches: the first batch of two pans would take 7 minutes, and the second batch of two pans would also take 7 minutes. Therefore, total time would be 14 minutes.\n\nBut hold on, the problem doesn't specify how many pans can fit in the oven at once. So, assuming that only one pan can be baked at a time is a safer bet, leading to 28 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if the oven can fit all four pans at once, then it would still take only 7 minutes for all four pans. But again, without knowing the oven's capacity, I can't make that assumption.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer depends on the oven's capacity, which isn't provided in the problem. However, in the absence of that information, maybe the problem expects me to assume that only one pan can be baked at a time.\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"It takes 7 minutes to bake one pan of cookies. How long will it take to bake 4 pans of cookies?\"\n\nThere's no mention of oven capacity or simultaneous baking. So, perhaps the intention is to simply multiply the time per pan by the number of pans, assuming sequential baking.\n\nTherefore, total time = 7 minutes/pans \u00d7 4 pans = 28 minutes.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should consider that baking time remains constant regardless of the number of pans, assuming they all fit in the oven. But again, without knowing the oven's capacity, that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is testing basic multiplication skills, and the answer is simply 28 minutes.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is likely straightforward: if one pan takes 7 minutes, four pans would take 4 times 7 minutes, assuming they are baked one after another.\n\nAlternatively, if the pans can be baked simultaneously, it would still take 7 minutes. But, as mentioned earlier, the problem doesn't specify the oven's capacity", "answer": "28", "equiv": false}, {"output": "128", "answer": "128", "equiv": true}, {"output": "24", "answer": "24", "equiv": true}, {"output": "423 \\text{ grams}", "answer": "423", "equiv": false}, {"output": "93", "answer": "93", "equiv": true}, {"output": "9", "answer": "9", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this math problem here: \"Matthew had 27 crackers. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 9 friends, how many crackers did each person eat?\" Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. Matthew has 27 crackers, and he gives them out equally to his 9 friends. The question is, how many crackers does each friend get?\n\nHmm, this sounds like a division problem. Division is used when we want to split something into equal parts. So, I think I need to divide the total number of crackers by the number of friends.\n\nSo, total crackers are 27, and there are 9 friends. So, 27 divided by 9 should give me the number of crackers each friend gets.\n\nLet me write that down: 27 \u00f7 9 = ?\n\nNow, I know that 9 times 3 is 27. So, 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. Therefore, 27 divided by 9 should be 3.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me think about it another way. If each friend gets 3 crackers, and there are 9 friends, then total crackers given out would be 9 \u00d7 3 = 27, which matches the total crackers Matthew had.\n\nSo, it makes sense that each friend gets 3 crackers.\n\nBut the question says, \"how many crackers did each person eat?\" Hmm, it says \"each person,\" but it doesn't specify if Matthew is included or not. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"Matthew had 27 crackers. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 9 friends, how many crackers did each person eat?\"\n\nOkay, so Matthew gave crackers to his 9 friends, and the question is about how many crackers each person ate. But it doesn't say anything about Matthew eating any crackers or his friends eating them. It just says he gave them out equally.\n\nMaybe the wording is a bit confusing. It might be a typo or something. Perhaps it meant to ask how many crackers each friend received, not necessarily how many they ate.\n\nAssuming that \"ate\" is the same as \"received,\" since there's no information about them eating the crackers, I'll proceed with the assumption that \"ate\" means \"received.\"\n\nSo, if Matthew gave out all 27 crackers equally to his 9 friends, and each friend received 3 crackers, then each person (friend) ate 3 crackers.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"each person,\" which could include Matthew. But the problem says he gave to his 9 friends, so presumably, Matthew didn't eat any crackers if he gave them all away.\n\nBut maybe Matthew also ate some crackers. The problem isn't entirely clear.\n\nLet me consider two scenarios:\n\n1. Matthew gave all 27 crackers to his 9 friends equally, and he didn't eat any.\n\n2. Matthew gave some crackers to his friends and also ate some himself.\n\nBut according to the problem, \"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 9 friends,\" and it's asking about how many crackers each person ate.\n\nSince it's not specified whether Matthew ate any crackers or not, and the problem says he \"gave\" the crackers to his friends, I'll assume that Matthew didn't eat any crackers, and he gave all 27 crackers to his 9 friends equally.\n\nTherefore, each friend received 3 crackers, and since \"each person\" likely refers to each friend, the answer should be 3 crackers per person.\n\nAlternatively, if \"each person\" includes Matthew, then we'd need to know how many crackers Matthew ate, but since he gave all his crackers to his friends, perhaps he ate none.\n\nBut the problem says \"each person ate,\" which might imply that both Matthew and his friends ate some crackers, but it's not clear.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll stick with the initial interpretation that \"each person\" refers to each friend, and since each friend received 3 crackers, and presumably ate them, the answer is 3 crackers per person.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that Matthew divided the crackers among his friends and himself, making it a total of 10 people (Matthew + 9 friends). In that case, 27 crackers divided by 10 people would be 2.7 crackers per person, but that doesn't make sense because you can't really have 0.7 of a cracker in this context.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"gave equal numbers of crackers to his 9 friends,\" which suggests that only the friends received crackers, and Matthew gave them up, perhaps ate none himself.\n\nGiven that, I think the first interpretation is correct: Matthew gave all 27 crackers to his 9 friends equally, so each friend got 3 crackers, and that's the answer.\n\nSo, the answer should be 3 crackers per person.\n\nBut", "answer": "3", "equiv": false}, {"output": "135", "answer": "135", "equiv": true}, {"output": "47", "answer": "47", "equiv": true}, {"output": "72", "answer": "72", "equiv": true}, {"output": "48", "answer": "48", "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": "5", "equiv": true}, {"output": "6835", "answer": "6835", "equiv": true}, {"output": "\\pi", "answer": "3.14", "equiv": false}, {"output": "5", "answer": "5", "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's see what's going on here. Jared's hardware store has been ordering power drills over several months, and there's a pattern to the number of drills ordered each month. The numbers are: 5 in January, 6 in February, 8 in March, and 11 in April. I need to figure out how many drills will be ordered in May if this pattern continues.\n\nFirst, I should look for a pattern in the numbers. Let's list them out:\n\n- January: 5\n\n- February: 6\n\n- March: 8\n\n- April: 11\n\nSo, the sequence is 5, 6, 8, 11.\n\nI need to find the next number in this sequence. To do that, I can look at the differences between consecutive terms.\n\nLet's calculate the differences:\n\n- February - January: 6 - 5 = 1\n\n- March - February: 8 - 6 = 2\n\n- April - March: 11 - 8 = 3\n\nSo, the differences are 1, 2, 3.\n\nIt looks like the difference is increasing by 1 each month. If this pattern continues, the difference between May and April should be 4 (since the last difference was 3).\n\nTherefore, the number of drills ordered in May would be 11 (April's order) plus 4, which equals 15.\n\nWait a minute, let me check if there's another way to look at this. Maybe there's a formula or a different pattern I'm missing.\n\nLet's see if there's a pattern in the cumulative total or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the differences are following a specific sequence. In this case, the differences are 1, 2, 3, and if the pattern continues, 4, which suggests an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is based on months. But I don't think that's the case here.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the number of drills ordered each month is related to the month number.\n\nLet's assign numbers to the months:\n\n- January: 1\n\n- February: 2\n\n- March: 3\n\n- April: 4\n\n- May: 5\n\nNow, let's see if there's a relationship between the month number and the number of drills ordered.\n\n- Month 1 (Jan): 5\n\n- Month 2 (Feb): 6\n\n- Month 3 (Mar): 8\n\n- Month 4 (Apr): 11\n\nIs there a formula that relates the month number to the number of drills?\n\nLet me try to find a formula.\n\nIf I look at the differences again:\n\n- From month 1 to 2: +1\n\n- From month 2 to 3: +2\n\n- From month 3 to 4: +3\n\nSo, each month, the increase is the month number minus 1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nMonth 2: 5 +1 = 6\n\nMonth 3: 6 +2 = 8\n\nMonth 4: 8 +3 = 11\n\nThen, month 5: 11 +4 = 15\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a general formula for the nth month.\n\nLet's try to find a general formula.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the sequence:\n\n5, 6, 8, 11, ...\n\nLet\u2019s see if it's an arithmetic sequence. In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Here, the differences are 1, 2, 3, which are not constant. So, it's not arithmetic.\n\nIs it geometric? In a geometric sequence, the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. Let's check:\n\n6/5 = 1.2\n\n8/6 \u2248 1.333...\n\n11/8 = 1.375...\n\nThe ratios are not constant, so it's not geometric.\n\nMaybe it's a quadratic sequence. In a quadratic sequence, the second difference is constant.\n\nLet's find the first differences:\n\n1, 2, 3\n\nNow, the second differences:\n\n2 - 1 = 1\n\n3 - 2 = 1\n\nThe second differences are constant at 1. So, this is a quadratic sequence.\n\nThe general form of a quadratic sequence is:\n\na_n = an^2 + bn + c\n\nWhere a, b, c are constants.\n\nWe can set up equations using the known terms to find a, b, c.\n\nGiven:\n\nn=1, a_1=5\n\nn=2, a_2=6\n\nn=3, a_3=8\n\nn=4, a_4=11\n\nLet's plug these into the general formula:\n\nFor n=1:\n\na(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 5\n\n", "answer": "15", "equiv": false}, {"output": "So Cheryl has 16 lemons. Then Lori buys 28 more lemons. I need to find out how many lemons they have altogether.\n\nOkay, so this seems like a straightforward addition problem. I just need to add the number of lemons Cheryl has to the number of lemons Lori bought.\n\nLet me write it down to make sure I'm getting this right:\n\nCheryl's lemons: 16\n\nLori's lemons: 28\n\nTotal lemons: 16 + 28\n\nNow, 16 plus 28. Let's see, 16 plus 20 is 36, and then plus 8 is 44. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because 16 plus 20 is 36, and then plus 8 would be 44, but I think I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait a minute, no. 16 plus 20 is indeed 36, and then plus 8 more would be 44. But I recall that 28 is 20 plus 8, so yes, 16 plus 28 should be 44.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as adding 10 to 16, which gives 26, and then adding another 10, which makes 36, and then adding 8 more makes 44.\n\nOr, I can break it down into tens and ones. 16 is 10 plus 6, and 28 is 20 plus 8. So, adding the tens together: 10 plus 20 is 30. Adding the ones together: 6 plus 8 is 14. Then, adding those sums together: 30 plus 14 is 44.\n\nAnother way to check is to add 28 to 16. I can add 30 to 16, which is 46, and then subtract 2 because 28 is 2 less than 30. So, 46 minus 2 is 44.\n\nWait, that confirms it again. So, no matter which way I approach it, I keep getting 44 as the total number of lemons.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other aspect to this problem. It says \"Cheryl counted 16 lemons\" and \"Lori bought 28 more lemons.\" It's asking for the total number of lemons the girls have altogether.\n\nAssuming that Cheryl and Lori are the only ones involved here, and there are no other lemons to account for, the total should just be the sum of their lemons.\n\nBut just to be thorough, I should make sure that there aren't any other variables or conditions in the problem. The question is: \"How many lemons do the girls have altogether?\"\n\nGiven that, yes, it's simply the addition of Cheryl's and Lori's lemons.\n\nSo, total lemons = Cheryl's lemons + Lori's lemons = 16 + 28 = 44.\n\nI think that's the answer. But I'll double-check the addition once more.\n\n16 plus 28:\n\nStart with 16.\n\nAdd 20 to 16: 16 + 20 = 36.\n\nThen add 8 to 36: 36 + 8 = 44.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can use column addition:\n\n  16\n\n+ 28\n\n---\n\n  44\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, the total number of lemons the girls have altogether is 44.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Lori bought 28 more lemons.\" Does \"more\" imply that Lori is adding to an existing amount, or that she bought 28 lemons separately?\n\nUpon re-reading, it says \"Cheryl counted 16 lemons. Lori bought 28 more lemons.\"\n\nIt seems like Cheryl has her 16 lemons, and Lori has her own 28 lemons. So, \"more\" in this context likely means in addition to Cheryl's count, Lori acquired 28 lemons.\n\nTherefore, the total should indeed be the sum of both their lemons.\n\nHowever, if \"more\" was referring to Lori buying 28 more lemons in addition to Cheryl's count, it might imply that Lori is adding to Cheryl's lemons. But the way it's phrased, \"Lori bought 28 more lemons,\" suggests that Lori purchased additional lemons separate from Cheryl's.\n\nBut to be absolutely sure, let's consider the English interpretation.\n\n\"Cheryl counted 16 lemons. Lori bought 28 more lemons.\"\n\nThis means Cheryl has 16 lemons, and Lori has an additional", "answer": "44", "equiv": false}, {"output": "12", "answer": "12", "equiv": true}, {"output": "40", "answer": "40", "equiv": true}, {"output": "102", "answer": "102", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: A teacher wants to arrange 60 boys and 72 girls into rows, with each row containing only boys or only girls. I need to find the greatest number of students that can be arranged in a single row.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. The teacher is separating boys and girls into their own rows, and I need to find the largest possible number of students in each row, given that all rows are either all boys or all girls.\n\nThis sounds like a problem involving the greatest common divisor (GCD), because we're looking for the largest number that can divide both the number of boys and the number of girls evenly.\n\nSo, the numbers are 60 boys and 72 girls. I need to find the GCD of 60 and 72.\n\nTo find the GCD, I can use the prime factorization method. Let's start by finding the prime factors of each number.\n\nFirst, 60:\n\n60 divided by 2 is 30,\n\n30 divided by 2 is 15,\n\n15 divided by 3 is 5,\n\nand 5 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 60 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5, or 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5.\n\nNext, 72:\n\n72 divided by 2 is 36,\n\n36 divided by 2 is 18,\n\n18 divided by 2 is 9,\n\n9 divided by 3 is 3,\n\nand 3 is a prime number.\n\nSo, the prime factorization of 72 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3, or 2\u00b3 \u00d7 3\u00b2.\n\nNow, to find the GCD, I need to take the lowest power of all the common prime factors.\n\nThe common prime factors between 60 and 72 are 2 and 3.\n\nThe lowest power of 2 in both factorizations is 2\u00b2 (since 60 has 2\u00b2 and 72 has 2\u00b3).\n\nThe lowest power of 3 in both factorizations is 3\u00b9 (since 60 has 3\u00b9 and 72 has 3\u00b2).\n\nSo, the GCD is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b9 = 4 \u00d7 3 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of students that can be arranged in a row is 12.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf each row has 12 students, then the number of rows for boys would be 60 divided by 12, which is 5 rows.\n\nFor girls, 72 divided by 12 is 6 rows.\n\nThat seems to work, because 12 divides both 60 and 72 evenly.\n\nBut is there a larger number that could work?\n\nLet's see, is there a number larger than 12 that divides both 60 and 72?\n\nLet's check 18, for example.\n\n60 divided by 18 is 3.333..., which is not an integer, so that doesn't work.\n\nHow about 15?\n\n60 divided by 15 is 4, and 72 divided by 15 is 4.8, which is not an integer.\n\nHow about 10?\n\n60 divided by 10 is 6, and 72 divided by 10 is 7.2, which is not an integer.\n\nHow about 24?\n\n60 divided by 24 is 2.5, which is not an integer, and 72 divided by 24 is 3.\n\nSince 24 doesn't divide 60 evenly, that doesn't work.\n\nSo, 12 seems to be the largest number that divides both 60 and 72 evenly.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm states that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.\n\nSo, starting with 72 and 60.\n\n72 minus 60 is 12.\n\nNow, GCD of 60 and 12.\n\n60 divided by 12 is 5 with no remainder, so GCD is 12.\n\nYes, that matches what I found earlier using prime factorization.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of students per row is indeed 12.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest number of students that could be arranged in a row.\"\n\nIs there any way to arrange more students per row?\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nDoes the teacher have to arrange all the boys and all the girls into rows of the same size?\n\nOr can different rows have different numbers of students?\n\nThe problem says: \"arrange them in such a way that only", "answer": "12", "equiv": false}, {"output": "48", "answer": "48", "equiv": true}, {"output": "29", "answer": "29", "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's see what's going on here.

It says that Lemon Heads come in packages of 5, and Ann ate 78 of them. I need to find out how many she has left. But wait, the problem doesn't specify how many packages she started with. Hmm, that seems like a problem.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. If Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads, and they come in packages of 5, perhaps I need to figure out how many packages she had initially and then see how many are left after she ate 78.\n\nBut actually, the problem is a bit tricky because it doesn't specify how many packages she started with. Maybe it's assuming that she had a certain number of packages, ate 78, and now we need to find out how many are left.\n\nLet me think differently. If each package has 5 Lemon Heads, and she ate 78, perhaps I need to see how many packages that corresponds to, or something like that.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about finding the remainder after she ate 78, assuming she had a certain number of packages. But without knowing the total number of packages she started with, it's hard to determine how many are left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply that she had some Lemon Heads, ate 78, and now has some left, and I need to find that number. But again, without knowing the initial amount, it's impossible to determine the exact number left.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the problem again: \"Lemon Heads come in packages of 5. Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?\"\n\nPerhaps it's assuming that she had exactly the number of Lemon Heads in a certain number of packages, and after eating 78, we need to find out how many are left. But without knowing the total number of packages she had, I can't determine the exact number left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about finding the remainder when 78 is divided by 5, since each package contains 5. Let me try that.\n\nSo, if each package has 5 Lemon Heads, and she ate 78, I can divide 78 by 5 to see how many full packages she ate and what the remainder is.\n\nLet's do the division: 78 divided by 5.\n\n5 times 15 is 75, which is less than 78.\n\n5 times 15 is 75, and 78 minus 75 is 3.\n\nSo, she ate 15 packages and had 3 Lemon Heads left over.\n\nWait, but the problem says she ate 78 Lemon Heads. So, if she ate 15 packages plus 3 extra, that means she must have had at least 15 packages plus some extra Lemon Heads.\n\nBut the problem is asking how many Lemon Heads she has left after eating 78.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to think about it differently.\n\nLet me assume that she had a certain number of packages to start with, say x packages, each containing 5 Lemon Heads, so she had 5x Lemon Heads initially.\n\nThen, she ate 78 Lemon Heads, so the number left would be 5x - 78.\n\nBut without knowing x, I can't find the exact number left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to find the remainder after eating as many full packages as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that she had some packages, ate 78 Lemon Heads, and now I need to find out how many are left, assuming she had enough packages to begin with.\n\nBut that still doesn't give me a specific number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to ask how many Lemon Heads are left after eating 78, given that they come in packages of 5, implying that perhaps the number left is a multiple of 5.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that she couldn't have eaten more than she had, so the number of packages she had must be at least 78 divided by 5, which is 15.6 packages. Since you can't have a fraction of a package, she must have had at least 16 packages.\n\nSo, if she had 16 packages, that's 80 Lemon Heads. She ate 78, so she has 2 left.\n\nBut if she had more than 16 packages, say 17 packages, which is 85 Lemon Heads, she eats 78, leaving her with 7.\n\nSimilarly, if she had 15 packages, that", "answer": "3", "equiv": false}, {"output": "1", "answer": "1", "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": "8", "equiv": true}, {"output": "12", "answer": "12", "equiv": true}, {"output": "65", "answer": "65", "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": "5", "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": "5", "equiv": true}, {"output": "12", "answer": "12", "equiv": true}, {"output": "10:1", "answer": "10:1", "equiv": true}, {"output": "85", "answer": "85", "equiv": true}, {"output": "15", "answer": "15", "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": "1", "equiv": true}, {"output": "56", "answer": "56", "equiv": true}, {"output": "20", "answer": "20", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here about Lexi making get-well-soon kits for flu season. She has 10 cans of chicken soup and 15 boxes of tissue, and she wants to make identical kits without any materials left over. I need to figure out the greatest number of kits she can make.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to make identical kits with no materials left over. That means each kit should have the same number of cans of chicken soup and the same number of boxes of tissue, and after making these kits, she shouldn't have any cans or boxes left.\n\nSo, I have to divide 10 cans of soup and 15 boxes of tissue into groups where each group has the same number of cans and boxes, and nothing is left over. I need to find the greatest number of such groups.\n\nThis sounds like a problem involving finding a common divisor of the two numbers, 10 and 15. Specifically, I think I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 15, because the GCD will tell me the largest number of kits that can be made where each kit has the same number of cans and boxes, with nothing left over.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One way is to list the divisors of each number and find the largest one that they have in common.\n\nFirst, list the divisors of 10:\n\n1, 2, 5, 10\n\nNow, list the divisors of 15:\n\n1, 3, 5, 15\n\nNow, find the common divisors:\n\n1 and 5\n\nThe greatest common divisor is 5.\n\nSo, the greatest number of identical kits Lexi can make is 5.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf she makes 5 kits, each kit would have:\n\n10 cans / 5 kits = 2 cans per kit\n\n15 boxes / 5 kits = 3 boxes per kit\n\nAnd indeed, 5 kits with 2 cans and 3 boxes each would use up all 10 cans and all 15 boxes, with nothing left over.\n\nWait a minute, is there a larger number than 5 that could work? Let's see.\n\nIf I try 10 kits, each kit would have:\n\n10 cans / 10 kits = 1 can per kit\n\n15 boxes / 10 kits = 1.5 boxes per kit\n\nBut I can't have half a box in a kit, so that doesn't work. That would mean some kits have more tissues than others, which contradicts the requirement for identical kits.\n\nWhat about 15 kits?\n\n10 cans / 15 kits = 2/3 can per kit\n\n15 boxes / 15 kits = 1 box per kit\n\nAgain, 2/3 of a can doesn't make sense in this context, so that's not possible.\n\nWhat about 1 kit?\n\n1 kit with all 10 cans and all 15 boxes. That would be identical, but the problem likely intends for multiple kits, but technically, 1 is allowed. However, since the question is asking for the greatest number of kits, 5 seems better.\n\nAlternatively, what about 3 kits?\n\n10 cans / 3 kits = 3.333... cans per kit\n\n15 boxes / 3 kits = 5 boxes per kit\n\nAgain, fractional cans don't work, so 3 kits isn't possible.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. Maybe I need to find the greatest number that divides both 10 and 15 without leaving a remainder.\n\nThat's exactly the definition of the GCD.\n\nSo, GCD of 10 and 15 is 5, as I found earlier.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of identical kits is 5.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the ratio of cans to boxes in each kit. If each kit has the same number of cans and boxes, then the ratio should be the same.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Each kit can have a different number of cans and boxes, as long as all kits have the same number of each.\n\nWait, no, the problem says identical kits, meaning each kit has the same number of cans and the same number of boxes.\n\nSo, the number of cans per kit must be an integer, and the number of boxes per kit must be an integer.\n\nSo, the number of kits must be a divisor of both 10 and 15.\n\nTherefore, the possible number of kits is the common divisors of 10 and 15, which are 1 and 5.\n\nAnd the greatest among them is 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5.\n\nBut let me consider another approach.

So, the guy needs 185 feet of rope in total to tie the wood joints on his house. He already has 46 feet of rope with him, and at the moment, he only needed 57 feet. The question is asking how many feet of rope his friends gave him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. He needs 185 feet overall, has 46 feet already, and currently needed 57 feet. So, probably, he used some rope and his friends contributed some more. I need to find out how much his friends gave him.\n\nLet me try to break it down.\n\n1. He starts with 46 feet of rope.\n\n2. He needs 57 feet at the moment. So, he uses some of his rope.\n\nBut wait, if he has 46 feet and needs 57 feet, that means he needs more rope than he has. So, he must have gotten some from his friends to meet this need.\n\nSo, the amount his friends gave him would be the difference between what he needed and what he had.\n\nSo, friends' rope = needed rope - had rope\n\nThat would be 57 - 46 = 11 feet.\n\nBut wait, the total he needs is 185 feet. So, maybe there's more to this.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf he needed 57 feet at the moment and his friends gave him 11 feet, but the total requirement is 185 feet.\n\nSo, perhaps after getting the 11 feet from his friends, he still needs more to reach the total.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nLet me consider the total rope required is 185 feet.\n\nHe has 46 feet initially.\n\nHis friends gave him some amount, let's call that X feet.\n\nSo, total rope he has now is 46 + X feet.\n\nBut he needed 57 feet at the moment, so perhaps he used 57 feet from what he has.\n\nSo, 46 + X - 57 = remaining rope.\n\nBut the problem says \"at the moment he only needed 57 feet,\" which might mean that after using 57 feet, he has some rope left.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose he had 46 feet initially.\n\nHis friends gave him X feet.\n\nSo, total rope now is 46 + X feet.\n\nHe needed 57 feet at the moment, so he used 57 feet from the total he has.\n\nSo, 46 + X - 57 = remaining rope.\n\nBut the problem says he \"needed 57 feet,\" which might imply that he used 57 feet, and the remaining rope should be enough to reach the total requirement of 185 feet.\n\nWait, no.\n\nThe problem says: \"he needs 185 feet of rope. If he has 46 feet of rope with him and at the moment he only needed 57 feet, how many feet of rope did his friends give to him?\"\n\nSo, perhaps he had 46 feet, needed 57 feet, so he asked his friends for some rope to cover the 57 feet needed.\n\nSo, the rope his friends gave him is the difference between what he needed and what he had.\n\nSo, friends' rope = needed rope - had rope = 57 - 46 = 11 feet.\n\nBut, the total requirement is 185 feet.

Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find the cost per pound of the beef jerky. If 3 pounds cost $34.23, then the cost per pound would be $34.23 divided by 3. Let me do that calculation.\n\n$34.23 \u00f7 3 = $11.41 per pound.\n\nAlright, now that I know each pound costs $11.41, I can find out the cost for 7 pounds by multiplying the cost per pound by 7.\n\n$11.41 \u00d7 7 = Let's see, 11 times 7 is 77, and 0.41 times 7 is 2.87. So, 77 + 2.87 is $79.87.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that multiplication. Maybe I should use a different approach to make sure I get the accurate result.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem gives the cost for 3 pounds, maybe I can find out how much 7 pounds would cost by setting up a proportion. So, if 3 pounds cost $34.23, then 7 pounds would cost x dollars. This can be written as:\n\n3 pounds / $34.23 = 7 pounds / x\n\nWait, actually, that might not be the best way. Let me think again.\n\nIf 3 pounds cost $34.23, then to find the cost for 7 pounds, I can find the cost per pound and then multiply by 7, as I did before. But maybe I made a mistake in my multiplication.\n\nLet me try calculating $11.41 times 7 again.\n\n11.41 \u00d7 7:\n\nFirst, 11 \u00d7 7 = 77\n\nThen, 0.41 \u00d7 7 = 2.87\n\nAdding them up: 77 + 2.87 = $79.87\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But somehow, I have a feeling that the answer might be different. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nAnother way could be to find how much 1 pound costs, and then multiply by 7.\n\nSo, $34.23 \u00f7 3 = $11.41 per pound\n\nThen, $11.41 \u00d7 7 = $79.87\n\nOkay, that's the same answer I got earlier. Maybe I'm overthinking this.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of unit price. The unit price is $11.41 per pound, and for 7 pounds, it would be $79.87.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to verify this. Maybe I can use the concept of proportions correctly this time.\n\nIf 3 pounds cost $34.23, then the cost per pound is $34.23 / 3 = $11.41, which is what I have already.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up a proportion like this:\n\n3 pounds / 7 pounds = $34.23 / x\n\nWait, that might be the correct proportion. Let me write that down.\n\n3/7 = 34.23/x\n\nNow, solve for x.\n\nCross-multiplying: 3x = 7 \u00d7 34.23\n\nSo, 3x = 239.61\n\nThen, x = 239.61 / 3\n\nx = $79.87\n\nOkay, that's the same answer again. It seems like no matter which way I approach it, I end up with $79.87.\n\nMaybe I should consider the possibility that the cost isn't exactly $11.41 per pound due to rounding.

And I need to figure out how long it'll take him to mow a square lawn that's 60 meters on each side, assuming he works at the same rate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about time and area, right? Because the size of the lawn is changing, and I need to find out how that affects the time he takes to mow it.\n\nI know that the area of a square is calculated by side squared, so for the first lawn, the area is 30 meters times 30 meters, which is 900 square meters. And for the second lawn, it's 60 meters times 60 meters, which is 3600 square meters.\n\nSo, the second lawn is larger than the first one. I need to find out how much longer it'll take him to mow the larger lawn.\n\nSince he works at the same rate, I think I need to find his mowing rate in terms of square meters per minute and then use that to find out the time for the larger lawn.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, find his mowing rate.\n\nHe mows 900 square meters in 45 minutes. So, his rate is area divided by time, which is 900 square meters divided by 45 minutes. Let me calculate that:\n\n900 \u00f7 45 = 20 square meters per minute.\n\nSo, Kevin mows 20 square meters per minute.\n\nNow, for the larger lawn, which is 3600 square meters, I can find the time by dividing the area by the rate.\n\nTime = area / rate = 3600 square meters / 20 square meters per minute.\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n3600 \u00f7 20 = 180 minutes.\n\nSo, it would take him 180 minutes to mow the 60-meter square lawn.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using ratios or something?\n\nLet me think.\n\nThe first lawn is 30 meters on each side, area 900 square meters, takes 45 minutes.\n\nThe second lawn is 60 meters on each side, area 3600 square meters.\n\nSo, the side length has doubled, from 30 to 60 meters.\n\nBut area scales with the square of the side length, so if the side doubles, the area quadruples.\n\nIndeed, 3600 is 4 times 900.\n\nSo, if the area is 4 times larger, and he mows at the same rate, it should take 4 times longer.\n\nSo, 45 minutes times 4 equals 180 minutes.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same answer, which is a good sign.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of proportions.\n\nIf 900 square meters takes 45 minutes, then 3600 square meters takes x minutes.\n\nSo, I can set up a proportion: 900/45 = 3600/x\n\nWait, actually, that's not quite right. Because 900 square meters corresponds to 45 minutes, and 3600 square meters corresponds to x minutes.\n\nSo, the ratio of area to time should be constant, since rate is constant.\n\nSo, 900/45 = 3600/x\n\nSimplify 900/45, that's 20, as I did earlier.\n\nSo, 20 = 3600/x\n\nThen, x = 3600/20 = 180 minutes.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I'm confident with this.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other factor I should be considering.\n\nIs there anything about the shape being square that matters here? Not really, because the area is what matters for mowing.\n\nIs there any efficiency difference in mowing larger areas? The problem says he works at the same rate, so I don't think so.\n\nCould there be a mistake in assuming the rate is constant? Well, the problem states \"assuming he works at the same rate,\" so I think it's fair to assume his mowing rate doesn't change.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the time per square meter.\n\nFrom the first lawn, time per square meter is 45 minutes / 900 square meters = 0.05 minutes per square meter.\n\nThen, for the second lawn, time would be 0.05 minutes per square meter times 3600 square meters, which is 180 minutes", "answer": "180", "equiv": false}, {"output": "22", "answer": "22", "equiv": true}, {"output": "13", "answer": "13", "equiv": true}, {"output": "0.63", "answer": "0.63", "equiv": true}, {"output": "15 \\text{ boys and } 30 \\text{ girls}", "answer": "30", "equiv": false}, {"output": "29", "answer": "29", "equiv": true}, {"output": "100", "answer": "100", "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": "7", "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": "6", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: Kristen has gift bags that come in packs of 12 and bows that come in packs of 5. She wants to have the same number of gift bags as bows. I need to find out the smallest number of gift bags she would have to buy to make this happen.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. She's buying gift bags in packs of 12 and bows in packs of 5. So, every time she buys a pack of gift bags, she gets 12 of them, and every pack of bows gives her 5 bows.\n\nShe wants the same number of each, meaning the total number of gift bags should equal the total number of bows.\n\nLet me think about this. If she buys one pack of gift bags, she gets 12 gift bags. To have the same number of bows, she would need 12 bows, but bows come in packs of 5. So, 1 pack of bows gives her 5 bows, which is not enough. She'd need to buy more packs of bows to reach at least 12 bows.\n\nWait, but if she buys 1 pack of gift bags (12 gift bags) and 3 packs of bows (3 * 5 = 15 bows), she has 12 gift bags and 15 bows, which are not equal.\n\nAlternatively, if she buys 2 packs of gift bags (24 gift bags) and 5 packs of bows (25 bows), that's still not equal.\n\nHmm, I need to find a number where the total gift bags equal the total bows.\n\nThis seems like a problem involving multiples. Specifically, I need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of both 12 and 5.\n\nWait, is that right? Let's see. The number of gift bags she buys will be a multiple of 12, since she's buying packs of 12. Similarly, the number of bows will be a multiple of 5.\n\nSo, I need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of both 12 and 5.\n\nIn math terms, that's the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 5.\n\nI remember that the LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.\n\nTo find the LCM of 12 and 5, I can list the multiples of each and find the smallest one they have in common.\n\nMultiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, etc.\n\nMultiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, etc.\n\nLooking at these, the first number they have in common is 60.\n\nSo, the LCM of 12 and 5 is 60.\n\nThat means the smallest number of gift bags and bows she can have, where the numbers are equal, is 60.\n\nBut the question asks for the smallest number of gift bags she would have to buy.\n\nSo, she needs to buy enough packs of gift bags to have 60 gift bags.\n\nSince each pack contains 12 gift bags, the number of packs she needs is 60 divided by 12, which is 5 packs.\n\nSimilarly, for bows, she would need to buy enough packs to have 60 bows. Since bows come in packs of 5, she would need 60 divided by 5, which is 12 packs.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking for the smallest number of gift bags she would have to buy, which is 60.\n\nWait a minute, but maybe they're asking for the number of packs of gift bags.\n\nThe problem says, \"the smallest number of gift bags she would have to buy.\"\n\nHmm, it says \"gift bags,\" not \"packs of gift bags.\"\n\nSo, the total number of gift bags is 60.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's a smaller number that works.\n\nIs there a number smaller than 60 that is a multiple of both 12 and 5?\n\nLooking back at the multiples, 12 and 5 don't share any common multiples below 60.\n\nSo, 60 is indeed the smallest number that is a multiple of both 12 and 5.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of gift bags she would have to buy is 60.\n\nWait, but let's think about it another way.\n\nMaybe using the concept of LCM is the right approach, but perhaps there's another method.\n\nI could also think about it in terms of equations.\n\nLet\u2019s say she buys x packs of gift bags and y packs of bows.\n\nThen, the total number of", "answer": "60", "equiv": false}, {"output": "10", "answer": "10", "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": "5", "equiv": true}, {"output": "17", "answer": "17", "equiv": true}, {"output": "34", "answer": "34", "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": "7", "equiv": true}, {"output": "56", "answer": "56", "equiv": true}, {"output": "2268", "answer": "2268", "equiv": true}, {"output": "19", "answer": "19", "equiv": true}, {"output": "14", "answer": "14", "equiv": true}, {"output": "\\text{Mr. Brown had } \\$200 \\text{ and his son had } \\$20.", "answer": "20", "equiv": false}, {"output": "30", "answer": "30", "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we know that a full moon occurs every 30 days, and the last full moon was on a Friday. We need to find out how many days will pass before another full moon falls on a Friday.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the days of the week and the full moon cycle. There are 7 days in a week, so the days repeat every 7 days. The full moon, however, occurs every 30 days. So, I need to find a point where the 30-day full moon cycle aligns again with a Friday.\n\nLet's think about it this way: starting from the last full moon on a Friday, I can add 30 days to find the next full moon and see what day of the week that falls on. Then, I can continue this process until the full moon lands on another Friday.\n\nDay 0: Friday (last full moon)\n\nDay 30: What day is this?\n\nTo find out, I can divide 30 by 7 and find the remainder, since there are 7 days in a week.\n\n30 divided by 7 is 4 weeks with 2 days remaining (because 7 * 4 = 28, and 30 - 28 = 2).\n\nSo, starting from Friday, adding 2 days brings us to Sunday. Therefore, the next full moon is on a Sunday.\n\nNow, let's find the full moon after that, which would be 30 days after the first next full moon, so 30 + 30 = 60 days from the last full moon.\n\n60 divided by 7 is 8 weeks with 4 days remaining (since 7 * 8 = 56, and 60 - 56 = 4).\n\nStarting from Friday, adding 4 days brings us to Tuesday. So, the full moon after that is on a Tuesday.\n\nNext, another 30 days later would be 60 + 30 = 90 days from the last full moon.\n\n90 divided by 7 is 12 weeks with 6 days remaining (7 * 12 = 84, 90 - 84 = 6).\n\nStarting from Friday, adding 6 days brings us to Thursday. So, the full moon after that is on a Thursday.\n\nAnother 30 days later would be 90 + 30 = 120 days from the last full moon.\n\n120 divided by 7 is 17 weeks with 1 day remaining (7 * 17 = 119, 120 - 119 = 1).\n\nStarting from Friday, adding 1 day brings us to Saturday. So, the full moon after that is on a Saturday.\n\nYet another 30 days later would be 120 + 30 = 150 days from the last full moon.\n\n150 divided by 7 is 21 weeks with 3 days remaining (7 * 21 = 147, 150 - 147 = 3).\n\nStarting from Friday, adding 3 days brings us to Monday. So, the full moon after that is on a Monday.\n\nNext, 150 + 30 = 180 days from the last full moon.\n\n180 divided by 7 is 25 weeks with 5 days remaining (7 * 25 = 175, 180 - 175 = 5).\n\nStarting from Friday, adding 5 days brings us to Wednesday. So, the full moon after that is on a Wednesday.\n\nAnother 30 days later would be 180 + 30 = 210 days from the last full moon.\n\n210 divided by 7 is exactly 30 weeks (7 * 30 = 210), so no remainder.\n\nStarting from Friday, adding 0 days keeps it on Friday. So, the full moon after that is on a Friday again.\n\nWait a minute, 210 days is exactly 30 weeks, which brings us back to Friday. So, it seems that every 210 days, the full moon falls on a Friday again.\n\nBut let's double-check this to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWe started with day 0: Friday.\n\nDay 30: Friday + 30 days = Friday + 4 weeks and 2 days = Sunday.\n\nDay 60: Sunday + 30 days = Sunday + 4 weeks and 2 days = Tuesday.\n\nDay 90: Tuesday + 30 days = Tuesday + 4 weeks and 2 days = Thursday.\n\nDay 120: Thursday + 30 days = Thursday + 4 weeks and 2 days =", "answer": "210", "equiv": false}, {"output": "20 \\text{ and } 22", "answer": "20", "equiv": false}, {"output": "6", "answer": "6", "equiv": true}, {"output": "15", "answer": "15", "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": "5", "equiv": true}, {"output": "13", "answer": "13", "equiv": true}, {"output": "291", "answer": "291", "equiv": true}, {"output": "11", "answer": "11", "equiv": true}, {"output": "56", "answer": "56", "equiv": true}, {"output": "17", "answer": "17", "equiv": true}, {"output": "34", "answer": "34", "equiv": true}, {"output": "13", "answer": "13", "equiv": true}, {"output": "54", "answer": "54", "equiv": true}, {"output": "97", "answer": "97", "equiv": true}, {"output": "33", "answer": "33", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here about making sandwiches for a class picnic. The parents have 72 turkey slices, 48 cheese slices, and 96 tomato slices. The question is asking for the greatest number of sandwiches they can make, with each sandwich having the same filling.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems like they want to make sandwiches using all three ingredients: turkey, cheese, and tomato slices. Each sandwich should have the same combination of these ingredients, and they want to make as many sandwiches as possible.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of sandwiches, I need to find out how many complete sets of slices I can make with the given amounts. Each sandwich would require one slice of turkey, one slice of cheese, and one slice of tomato, assuming that's the filling for each sandwich.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"each sandwich has the same filling,\" which could mean that all sandwiches have the same combination of ingredients, but it doesn't specify exactly how many slices of each are needed per sandwich. Maybe it's not necessarily one of each?\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"each sandwich has the same filling.\" It doesn't specify how many slices of each ingredient per sandwich, just that each sandwich has the same filling. Maybe the filling is a combination of multiple slices of the same type?\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Perhaps the filling is a mixture of turkey, cheese, and tomato slices, and each sandwich requires a certain number of each.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the filling is just one type of slice per sandwich, but all sandwiches have the same type of filling. In that case, they would choose one type of slice to use in all sandwiches, and make as many sandwiches as the smallest quantity allows.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because they have three different types of slices. If they choose one type, say turkey, they could make 72 sandwiches with turkey slices, but they have more tomato slices (96), so choosing tomato would allow more sandwiches.\n\nBut the problem says \"each sandwich has the same filling,\" which suggests that all sandwiches have the same combination of ingredients, not necessarily the same type.\n\nMaybe I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of slices of each type, assuming that each sandwich gets an equal number of each type of slice.\n\nLet me consider that. If I let each sandwich have t turkey slices, c cheese slices, and m tomato slices, then the number of sandwiches s would be s = 72/t = 48/c = 96/m.\n\nTo maximize s, I need to find the greatest s that divides all three quantities 72, 48, and 96.\n\nIn other words, s is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72, 48, and 96.\n\nSo, I need to calculate GCD(72, 48, 96).\n\nFirst, find GCD of 72 and 48.\n\nThe prime factors of 72 are 2^3 * 3^2.\n\nThe prime factors of 48 are 2^4 * 3^1.\n\nThe GCD is the product of the lowest powers of common prime factors, which is 2^3 * 3^1 = 8 * 3 = 24.\n\nNow, find GCD of this result (24) and the third number, 96.\n\nPrime factors of 96 are 2^5 * 3^1.\n\nGCD of 24 (2^3 * 3^1) and 96 (2^5 * 3^1) is again 2^3 * 3^1 = 24.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of sandwiches they can make is 24, with each sandwich having 72/24 = 3 turkey slices, 48/24 = 2 cheese slices, and 96/24 = 4 tomato slices.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"each sandwich has the same filling.\" Does \"filling\" refer to the combination of slices, or just a single type of slice?\n\nIf filling means a single type of slice, then they would make sandwiches with only one type of slice, and the number of sandwiches would be limited by the ingredient with the fewest slices.\n\nIn that case, they have 72 turkey, 48 cheese, and 96 tomato slices. The limiting factor is cheese with 48 slices, so they could make 48 sandwiches, each with one cheese slice, and use some of the other slices.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the earlier approach using GCD.\n\nI need to clarify what \"same filling\" means.\n\nIf \"same filling\" means each sandwich has the same combination of slices, then my first approach with GCD makes sense.\n\nIf \"same filling\" means each sandwich has the same type of slice, then", "answer": "24", "equiv": false}, {"output": "84", "answer": "84", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here. It says that they travel at a speed of 328 feet every minute, and they traveled for 9 minutes. I need to find out how far HappyLand is from SFL. Okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. They're moving at a constant speed, and I need to find the total distance they covered in 9 minutes. Distance, speed, and time are related by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\]\n\nIn this case, the speed is 328 feet per minute, and the time is 9 minutes. So, plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 328 \\, \\text{feet.minute}^{-1} \\times 9 \\, \\text{minutes} \\]\n\nWhen I multiply these, the minutes unit cancels out, leaving me with feet, which is what I want. So:\n\n\\[ \\text{distance} = 328 \\times 9 \\, \\text{feet} \\]\n\nNow, I just need to calculate 328 multiplied by 9. Let's do that step by step.\n\nFirst, 300 times 9 is 2700.\n\nThen, 20 times 9 is 180.\n\nFinally, 8 times 9 is 72.\n\nNow, add those up:\n\n\\[ 2700 + 180 = 2880 \\]\n\n\\[ 2880 + 72 = 2952 \\]\n\nSo, the total distance is 2952 feet.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to check this? Maybe I can use division to verify. If they traveled 2952 feet in 9 minutes, then the speed should be:\n\n\\[ \\text{speed} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{time}} = \\frac{2952 \\, \\text{feet}}{9 \\, \\text{minutes}} \\]\n\nLet's divide 2952 by 9.\n\n9 times 328 is 2952, so yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in smaller parts. Let's say they travel for 1 minute: 328 feet.\n\nFor 9 minutes: 9 times 328.\n\nI can break it down:\n\n\\[ 9 \\times 328 = (10 - 1) \\times 328 = 10 \\times 328 - 1 \\times 328 = 3280 - 328 = 2952 \\, \\text{feet} \\]\n\nThat matches what I got earlier.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this? Maybe using addition repeatedly, but that would be time-consuming.\n\n\\[ 328 + 328 = 656 \\]\n\n\\[ 656 + 328 = 984 \\]\n\n\\[ 984 + 328 = 1312 \\]\n\n\\[ 1312 + 328 = 1640 \\]\n\n\\[ 1640 + 328 = 1968 \\]\n\n\\[ 1968 + 328 = 2296 \\]\n\n\\[ 2296 + 328 = 2624 \\]\n\n\\[ 2624 + 328 = 2952 \\]\n\nAgain, 2952 feet.\n\nWait, the problem might be expecting the answer in miles, since it's a distance between two places.

Let me check.\n\nThe problem says \"how far is HappyLand from SFL,\" and the units are in feet and minutes, but it doesn't specify the desired unit for the answer. However, since the speed is given in feet per minute, it's likely that the answer should be in feet.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should convert it to miles as well.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many feet are in a mile.

Let's see:\n\n45 \u00f7 12 = 3.75\n\nHmm, 3.75 cases, but cases can't be fractional, right? So, she needs 3 full cases and some extra boxes. Let's see how many boxes that is.\n\nIf she has 3 full cases, that's 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 boxes. Now, subtract that from the total boxes she sold:\n\n45 - 36 = 9 boxes\n\nSo, she needs 3 full cases and 9 extra boxes. But wait, the question says \"how many cases of 12 boxes, plus extra boxes does Nancy need?\" I think it's asking for the number of full cases and the remaining boxes separately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking how many cases she needs to hold all 45 boxes, considering that each case holds 12 boxes. In that case, she would need 4 cases to hold all the boxes, since 3 cases only hold 36 boxes, and she has 45 boxes in total.\n\nWait, but 3 cases hold 36 boxes, and she has 9 extra boxes. So, does she need an additional case for those 9 boxes? Yes, she does, because you can't have boxes without a case, I guess, unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, total cases needed would be 4, with the fourth case containing only 9 boxes.\n\nAlternatively, if cases can be partially filled, then she only needs 4 cases: 3 fully filled and 1 partially filled with 9 boxes.\n\nBut the question seems to be asking for the number of cases and extra boxes, but \"extra boxes\" might refer to boxes beyond complete cases.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. If each case holds 12 boxes, and she has 45 boxes, how many cases does she need, and how many boxes are left over.\n\nThis is essentially a division problem where we're finding the quotient and the remainder.\n\nSo, 45 divided by 12 is 3 with a remainder of 9.\n\nThat means she needs 3 full cases and 9 additional boxes, which would require another case if she needs to pack all boxes.\n\nSo, total cases needed are 4, with the last case not fully filled.\n\nAlternatively, if she can have partially filled cases, then she needs 4 cases: 3 with 12 boxes each and 1 with 9 boxes.\n\nBut the question is a bit unclear on whether \"extra boxes\" means boxes beyond complete cases or if it's referring to the partially filled case.\n\nMaybe I should present it as 3 cases and 9 extra boxes, but considering that cases are meant to hold 12 boxes, and she has 9 boxes left over, which might still require an additional case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cases are only considered complete if they have 12 boxes, and any fewer are just extra boxes not in a case, but that seems unlikely.\n\nIn real-world terms, if you have cases designed to hold 12 boxes, and you have 45 boxes, you'd need 4 cases: 3 fully filled and 1 partially filled with 9 boxes.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer should be 4 cases in total, with 9 boxes in the last case.\n\nBut the question seems to ask for \"how many cases of 12 boxes, plus extra boxes does Nancy need?\"\n\nMaybe it's asking for the number of full cases and then the number of extra boxes that don't fill a complete case.\n\nIn that interpretation, it would be 3 full cases and 9 extra boxes.\n\nBut perhaps \"cases of 12 boxes\" refers to the full cases, and \"extra boxes\" are those beyond the full cases.\n\nSo, 3 cases of 12 boxes, and 9 extra boxes.\n\nBut the problem might be expecting a specific format for the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for the number of cases needed to hold all the boxes, considering that each case holds 12 boxes.\n\nIn that case, since 3 cases hold 36 boxes, and there are 45 boxes, she needs an additional case for the remaining 9 boxes, totaling 4 cases.\n\nSo, total cases needed are 4.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider the division again.\n\n45 \u00f7 12 = 3 with a remainder of 9.\n\nSo, 3 full cases and 1 partial case.\n\nTherefore, total cases needed are 4.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is", "answer": "4", "equiv": false}, {"output": "2", "answer": "2", "equiv": true}, {"output": "18", "answer": "18", "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": "8", "equiv": true}, {"output": "332", "answer": "332", "equiv": true}, {"output": "14", "answer": "14", "equiv": true}, {"output": "70", "answer": "70", "equiv": true}, {"output": "8243", "answer": "8243", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: a lab technician cuts a 12-inch piece of tubing into two pieces, and one piece is twice as long as the other.

Since these two pieces together make up the original 12-inch tube, I can set up an equation:\n\nx + 2x = 12\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n3x = 12\n\nNow, to find x, I just need to divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 12 / 3\n\nx = 4\n\nSo, the shorter piece is 4 inches long, and the longer piece is twice that, which is 8 inches.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If I add 4 inches and 8 inches, that does equal 12 inches, which matches the original length. Also, 8 is indeed twice as long as 4, so that makes sense.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using ratios or something like that?\n\nWell, since one piece is twice as long as the other, the ratio of their lengths is 1:2. That means, for every 1 part of the shorter piece, the longer piece is 2 parts. Together, they make 3 parts, and the total length is 12 inches.\n\nSo, each part is 12 inches divided by 3, which is 4 inches. Therefore, the shorter piece is 1 part, or 4 inches, and the longer piece is 2 parts, or 8 inches. That's the same answer I got earlier.\n\nHmm, maybe I can use algebra again, but set up the equation differently. Suppose I let the longer piece be y inches, then the shorter piece would be y/2 inches, since the longer one is twice as long.\n\nSo, y + y/2 = 12\n\nCombining like terms, that's (3/2)y = 12\n\nTo solve for y, I can multiply both sides by 2/3:\n\ny = 12 * (2/3)\n\ny = 8 inches\n\nThen, the shorter piece is y/2 = 8/2 = 4 inches. Again, the same answer.\n\nIt seems like no matter how I approach it, I end up with the shorter piece being 4 inches and the longer one being 8 inches.\n\nLet me try another approach, just for kicks. What if I use the concept of proportions?\n\nThe total parts are 3 (1 part shorter + 2 parts longer), and the total length is 12 inches. So, the shorter piece is 1/3 of the total length, and the longer piece is 2/3 of the total length.\n\n1/3 of 12 inches is 4 inches, and 2/3 of 12 inches is 8 inches. Once more, the same result.\n\nAlright, I think I've confirmed it enough. It's clear that the two pieces are 4 inches and 8 inches long.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, what if the technician cut the tube into two equal pieces? Each would be 6 inches, but that's not the case here because one has to be twice as long as the other. So, 4 inches and 8 inches makes sense because 8 is indeed twice 4.\n\nAlso, if I consider the difference in their lengths, the longer piece is 8 inches and the shorter is 4 inches, so the difference is 4 inches. Is there a way to use that in the problem? Maybe, but it's probably more complicated than necessary.\n\nLet me see: if I let the shorter piece be x, then the longer piece is 2x, and the difference is 2x - x = x. We know the total length is 12 inches, and the difference is x inches. But we already know x + 2x = 12, which is 3x = 12, so x = 4. That gives the same answer again.\n\nI think I've beaten this problem to death. No matter which way I look at it, the answer is consistently 4 inches and 8 inches.\n\nJust to make sure there aren't any tricks or additional considerations, let's think about the units. The original tube is 12 inches long, and we're dealing with inches throughout, so no conversion issues there.\n\nAlso, the problem", "answer": "4", "equiv": false}, {"output": "40", "answer": "40", "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": "4", "equiv": true}, {"output": "9794", "answer": "9794", "equiv": true}, {"output": "14", "answer": "14", "equiv": true}, {"output": "90", "answer": "90", "equiv": true}, {"output": "9:4", "answer": "9:4", "equiv": true}, {"output": "16", "answer": "16", "equiv": true}, {"output": "40", "answer": "40", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here about Jaden making first-aid kits. He's got 39 large bandages and 26 small bandages, and he wants each kit to be identical with no bandages left over. I need to find out the greatest number of first-aid kits he could put together.\n\nOkay, so first I need to understand what's being asked. He has two different types of bandages: large and small. He has 39 large and 26 small. He wants to divide these into kits that are all the same, without any bandages left over. So, basically, each kit should have the same number of large bandages and the same number of small bandages.\n\nThis sounds like a problem involving finding a common divisor or something similar. Maybe I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, 39 and 26. The GCD would tell me the largest number that divides both amounts evenly, which would correspond to the greatest number of identical kits he can make.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One way is to list all the divisors of each number and find the largest one they have in common.\n\nFirst, let's list the divisors of 39.\n\n39 can be divided by 1, 3, 13, and 39.\n\nNow, let's list the divisors of 26.\n\n26 can be divided by 1, 2, 13, and 26.\n\nLooking at both lists, the common divisors are 1 and 13. The largest one is 13.\n\nSo, the GCD of 39 and 26 is 13.\n\nDoes that mean Jaden can make 13 identical kits?\n\nLet me check.\n\nIf he makes 13 kits, then each kit would have 39 \u00f7 13 = 3 large bandages and 26 \u00f7 13 = 2 small bandages. That seems to work, and there are no bandages left over.\n\nIs there a way to make more than 13 kits? Let's see.\n\nSuppose he makes 1 kit. That would be 39 large and 26 small bandages in one kit, which is possible, but not the greatest number.\n\nIf he makes 2 kits, then each kit would have 19.5 large bandages and 13 small bandages, but you can't have half a bandage, so that doesn't work.\n\nWait, no. 39 divided by 2 is 19.5, which isn't an integer, so that's not possible. There must be an integer number of bandages per kit.\n\nWhat about 13 kits? That gives 3 large and 2 small per kit, which works.\n\nIs there another number higher than 13 that divides both 39 and 26 evenly?\n\nWell, 13 is the GCD, so there shouldn't be a larger number that divides both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of ratios or something else, but I think GCD is the right approach here.\n\nLet me consider another method to confirm.\n\nAnother way to find the GCD is to use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm says that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.\n\nSo, starting with 39 and 26.\n\n39 minus 26 is 13.\n\nNow, GCD of 26 and 13.\n\n26 divided by 13 is 2 with no remainder, so the GCD is 13.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nAlternatively, using prime factorization.\n\n39 can be factored into 3 \u00d7 13.\n\n26 can be factored into 2 \u00d7 13.\n\nThe common factor is 13, so GCD is 13.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nSo, it seems consistent that the GCD is 13.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of identical kits Jaden can put together is 13.\n\nJust to make sure, let's think about what would happen if he tried to make fewer kits.\n\nFor example, if he makes 1 kit, it's 39 large and 26 small.\n\nIf he makes 13 kits, it's 3 large and 2 small per kit.\n\nIf he makes 26 kits, he would need 39 \u00f7 26 = 1.5 large bandages per kit, which isn't possible since you can't have half a bandage.\n\nSimilarly, making 39 kits would require 26 \u00f7 39, which is less than 1 small bandage per kit, which also doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, 13 kits seems to be the maximum number where each kit has an integer number of", "answer": "13", "equiv": false}, {"output": "212", "answer": "212", "equiv": true}, {"output": "21", "answer": "21", "equiv": true}, {"output": "56", "answer": "56", "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": "6", "equiv": true}, {"output": "63", "answer": "63", "equiv": true}, {"output": "18", "answer": "18", "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": "7", "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": "3", "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": "6", "equiv": true}, {"output": "705", "answer": "705", "equiv": true}, {"output": "24", "answer": "24", "equiv": true}, {"output": "40", "answer": "40", "equiv": true}, {"output": "14", "answer": "14", "equiv": true}, {"output": "197", "answer": "197", "equiv": true}, {"output": "8400", "answer": "8318", "equiv": false}, {"output": "So I have this problem here: a florist has 12 tulips and 18 carnations. The florist wants to create identical bouquets without any leftover flowers. I need to find out the greatest number of bouquets the florist can make.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to create identical bouquets without any leftover flowers. That means each bouquet will have the same number of tulips and the same number of carnations, and there should be no flowers left over after making the bouquets.\n\nSo, I need to divide the 12 tulips and 18 carnations into groups where each group has the same number of tulips and the same number of carnations, and nothing is left over.\n\nThis sounds like a problem involving finding a common divisor of the two numbers, 12 and 18. Specifically, I think I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 18, because the GCD will tell me the largest number of bouquets I can make where each bouquet has the same number of each type of flower without any leftovers.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One way to find the GCD is to list all the divisors of each number and find the largest one that they have in common.\n\nFirst, I'll list the divisors of 12:\n\n12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\nNow, the divisors of 18:\n\n18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\n\nLooking at both lists, the common divisors are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The greatest common divisor is 6.\n\nSo, the GCD of 12 and 18 is 6.\n\nDoes that mean the florist can make 6 identical bouquets?\n\nLet me check.\n\nIf the florist makes 6 bouquets, then each bouquet would have:\n\nNumber of tulips per bouquet: 12 tulips \u00f7 6 bouquets = 2 tulips per bouquet\n\nNumber of carnations per bouquet: 18 carnations \u00f7 6 bouquets = 3 carnations per bouquet\n\nSo, each bouquet would have 2 tulips and 3 carnations, and there would be no flowers left over. That seems to satisfy the condition.\n\nBut wait, is 6 the greatest number possible? Let's see if I can make more than 6 bouquets.\n\nSuppose I try to make 12 bouquets.\n\nThen, each bouquet would have:\n\n12 tulips \u00f7 12 bouquets = 1 tulip per bouquet\n\n18 carnations \u00f7 12 bouquets = 1.5 carnations per bouquet\n\nBut I can't have half a carnation in a bouquet; flowers are discrete items, so I can't split them that way. Therefore, 12 bouquets wouldn't work because it would leave some carnations unmatched.\n\nWhat about 3 bouquets?\n\n12 tulips \u00f7 3 bouquets = 4 tulips per bouquet\n\n18 carnations \u00f7 3 bouquets = 6 carnations per bouquet\n\nAgain, that works, but it's fewer bouquets than 6.\n\nWhat about 2 bouquets?\n\n12 tulips \u00f7 2 bouquets = 6 tulips per bouquet\n\n18 carnations \u00f7 2 bouquets = 9 carnations per bouquet\n\nThat also works, but again, it's fewer bouquets than 6.\n\nAnd 1 bouquet:\n\n12 tulips \u00f7 1 bouquet = 12 tulips per bouquet\n\n18 carnations \u00f7 1 bouquet = 18 carnations per bouquet\n\nThat works too, but again, it's only one bouquet.\n\nSo, among these options, 6 bouquets seems to be the greatest number where each bouquet has a whole number of tulips and carnations, with no leftovers.\n\nLet me consider another approach to confirm this.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of this problem in terms of grouping the flowers.\n\nI need to group the tulips and carnations into sets where each set has the same number of tulips and the same number of carnations.\n\nThe number of sets I can make is limited by the smaller number of flowers, but I have to consider both types.\n\nThis is similar to dividing both numbers by the same divisor.\n\nThe greatest number of bouquets corresponds to the greatest divisor that divides both 12 and 18 exactly.\n\nAgain, that's the GCD of 12 and 18, which is 6.\n\nAnother way to find the GCD is to use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm states that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.\n\nSo, GCD(18, 12) = GCD(12", "answer": "6", "equiv": false}, {"output": "190.80", "answer": "190.8", "equiv": true}, {"output": "180", "answer": "180", "equiv": true}, {"output": "16", "answer": "16", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here from Irene's Bakery. They sell muffins in packages of 18 and cookies in packages of 5. The manager noticed that yesterday afternoon, they sold the same number of muffins and cookies. And I need to find the smallest number of muffins that the bakery could have sold.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, I need to understand what's being asked. They sold the same number of muffins and cookies, but muffins come in packages of 18 and cookies in packages of 5. So, it's not about the number of packages, but the total number of muffins equaling the total number of cookies.\n\nLet me try to translate this into mathematical terms. Let\u2019s say they sold M packages of muffins and C packages of cookies. Each package of muffins has 18 muffins, and each package of cookies has 5 cookies. So, the total number of muffins sold is 18M, and the total number of cookies sold is 5C.\n\nAccording to the problem, the number of muffins sold equals the number of cookies sold, so:\n\n18M = 5C\n\nNow, I need to find the smallest number of muffins sold, which is 18M, given that 18M = 5C.\n\nThis seems like a problem involving multiples or perhaps the least common multiple (LCM) of some numbers. But let's see.\n\nI need to find the smallest M such that 18M is a multiple of 5, because it has to equal 5C for some integer C.\n\nIn other words, 18M must be divisible by 5.\n\nLet me think about the prime factors of 18 and 5.\n\n18 = 2 * 3^2\n\n5 is a prime number itself.\n\nSo, for 18M to be divisible by 5, M must include the factor 5, because 18 doesn't have 5 as a factor.\n\nSimilarly, for 5C to be divisible by 18, C must include the factors of 18, which are 2 and 3^2, since 5 doesn't have those.\n\nWait, but according to the equation 18M = 5C, both sides need to be equal, so they must have the same prime factors.\n\nLet me try to find M and C that satisfy this equation.\n\nLet's solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nFrom 18M = 5C, I can write C = (18/5)M.\n\nSince C must be an integer (because you can't sell a fraction of a package), (18/5)M must be an integer.\n\nThis means that M must be a multiple of 5, so that the 5 in the denominator cancels out.\n\nLet\u2019s set M = 5K, where K is a positive integer.\n\nThen, C = (18/5)*(5K) = 18K.\n\nSo, for any positive integer K, M = 5K and C = 18K will satisfy the equation 18M = 5C.\n\nNow, the number of muffins sold is 18M = 18*(5K) = 90K.\n\nSimilarly, the number of cookies sold is 5C = 5*(18K) = 90K.\n\nSo, the total number of muffins sold is 90K, where K is a positive integer.\n\nThe smallest number of muffins sold would be when K = 1, which gives 90 muffins.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf M = 5, then the number of muffin packages is 5, so total muffins are 18*5 = 90.\n\nThen, C = 18, so the number of cookie packages is 18, total cookies are 5*18 = 90.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nIs there a smaller K where K is an integer?\n\nK has to be at least 1, so 90 is the smallest number.\n\nAlternatively, if K=2, then muffins = 180, cookies=180, which is larger.\n\nSo, the smallest number of muffins sold is 90.\n\nWait a minute, is there a smaller number than 90 that satisfies the condition?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe problem is to find the smallest number of muffins sold, given that the number of muffins equals the number of cookies, and muffins are sold in packages of 18, cookies in packages of 5.\n\nSo, the number of muffins must be a multiple of 18, and the number of cookies must be a multiple of 5.\n\nAnd these two multiples must be equal.\n\nSo, we're looking for the smallest number that is a multiple of both", "answer": "90", "equiv": false}, {"output": "140", "answer": "140", "equiv": true}, {"output": "38 \\text{ cents}", "answer": "38", "equiv": false}, {"output": "19", "answer": "19", "equiv": true}, {"output": "11", "answer": "11", "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": "2", "equiv": true}, {"output": "220", "answer": "220", "equiv": true}, {"output": "30", "answer": "30", "equiv": true}, {"output": "24", "answer": "24", "equiv": true}, {"output": "62", "answer": "62", "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": "7", "equiv": true}, {"output": "20", "answer": "20", "equiv": true}, {"output": "43", "answer": "43", "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": "6", "equiv": true}, {"output": "9", "answer": "9", "equiv": true}, {"output": "18", "answer": "18", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this problem here: I'm planting 50 apple trees and 30 peach trees, and I want the same number and type of trees per row. I need to find out the maximum number of trees I can plant per row. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure that each row has the same number of trees and that all trees in a row are of the same type. So, for apple trees, I'll have rows with only apple trees, and for peach trees, rows with only peach trees.\n\nI need to find the maximum number of trees per row, but with the constraint that the number is the same for both types of trees. That means the number of trees per row has to divide both the number of apple trees and the number of peach trees.\n\nSo, I'm looking for a number that can divide both 50 and 30 evenly. That sounds like finding a common divisor of 50 and 30. But the problem says \"the maximum number of trees per row,\" so I think I need the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 50 and 30.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One way is to list all the divisors of each number and find the largest one that's common to both.\n\nFirst, find the divisors of 50:\n\n1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50.\n\nNow, find the divisors of 30:\n\n1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.\n\nNow, look for the common divisors:\n\n1, 2, 5, 10.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor is 10.\n\nDoes that make sense in the context of the problem? If I plant 10 trees per row, for apple trees, I would have 50 \u00f7 10 = 5 rows of apple trees. For peach trees, 30 \u00f7 10 = 3 rows of peach trees. That seems to work.\n\nBut wait, is there a larger number that could work? Let's see, is there any number larger than 10 that divides both 50 and 30?\n\nLet's check 15. 15 divides 30 (30 \u00f7 15 = 2), but 15 does not divide 50 evenly (50 \u00f7 15 is approximately 3.333, which is not an integer). So, 15 doesn't work.\n\nHow about 20? 20 divides 30? 30 \u00f7 20 = 1.5, not an integer. So, no.\n\n25 divides 50 (50 \u00f7 25 = 2), but 25 does not divide 30 evenly (30 \u00f7 25 = 1.2). So, no.\n\nAnd 50 divides 50 (50 \u00f7 50 = 1), but 50 does not divide 30 (30 \u00f7 50 = 0.6). So, no.\n\nTherefore, 10 is indeed the largest number that divides both 50 and 30 evenly.\n\nAnother way to find the GCD is to use prime factorization.\n\nLet's factorize 50 and 30.\n\n50 = 2 \u00d7 5^2\n\n30 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5\n\nNow, the GCD is the product of the lowest powers of common prime factors.\n\nCommon prime factors are 2 and 5.\n\nSo, GCD = 2 \u00d7 5 = 10.\n\nThis confirms the earlier result.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says \"the same number and type of trees per row.\" Does that mean that all rows have the same number of trees, and each row has only one type of tree?\n\nOr could it mean that each row has the same number of each type of tree?\n\nI need to be careful here. The problem says \"the same number and type of trees per row.\"\n\nI think it means that each row contains trees of the same type, and the number of trees per row is the same for both types.\n\nSo, all apple tree rows have the same number of trees, and all peach tree rows have the same number of trees, and these numbers are equal.\n\nWait, but that would mean the number of trees per row for apples is equal to the number per row for peaches.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because the total numbers are different.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"I want the same number and type of trees per row.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to interpret it as each row has trees of the same type, and the number of trees per row is the", "answer": "10", "equiv": false}, {"output": "9", "answer": "9", "equiv": true}, {"output": "90", "answer": "90", "equiv": true}, {"output": "59", "answer": "59", "equiv": true}, {"output": "88", "answer": "88", "equiv": true}, {"output": "12", "answer": "12", "equiv": true}, {"output": "76", "answer": "76", "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": "10", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: a school has 14 students signed up for trivia teams, and they want to divide these students into 4 teams with the same number of students on each team. The question is asking how many more students need to sign up to make this possible.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. We have 14 students and 4 teams, and we want each team to have the same number of students. That means the total number of students should be divisible by 4.\n\nSo, if we have 14 students and we divide them into 4 teams, 14 divided by 4 is 3.5. But you can't have half a student, right? So that means we can't divide 14 students equally into 4 teams. We need a whole number of students per team.\n\nSo, the next step is to figure out what the smallest number is that's greater than or equal to 14 and divisible by 4. That way, we can see how many more students need to sign up to reach that number.\n\nLet me think about multiples of 4 around 14. Multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and so on. So, 12 is less than 14, which won't work because we can't have fewer students than signed up. So, the next multiple is 16.\n\n16 divided by 4 is 4. So, if we have 16 students, we can have 4 teams with 4 students each. That sounds perfect.\n\nNow, we have 14 students already signed up, and we need 16 students in total. So, how many more students need to sign up? That's simply 16 minus 14, which is 2.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this? Maybe I'm missing something. Let's double-check.\n\nWe need the total number of students to be divisible by 4. Current number is 14. 14 divided by 4 is 3.5, which isn't a whole number. So, we need to find the smallest number greater than or equal to 14 that is divisible by 4.\n\nAs I thought, that's 16. So, 16 minus 14 is 2.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about remainders. If I divide 14 by 4, I get 3 full teams and a remainder. Let's see: 4 times 3 is 12, and 14 minus 12 is 2. So, there are 2 students left over.\n\nTo make full teams, I need enough students to cover those leftovers. So, if I have 2 students left over, I need 4 minus 2, which is 2 more students to make another full team.\n\nWait, but in this case, since I'm already planning to have 4 teams, I need to make sure that the total number of students is a multiple of 4.\n\nYes, so again, that brings me back to needing 16 students in total, which is 4 teams of 4 students each.\n\nTherefore, 16 minus 14 is 2.\n\nLet me consider if there's a general formula for this. If you have n students and want to divide them into t teams with equal members, you need n to be divisible by t.\n\nIn this case, n = 14 and t = 4. Since 14 is not divisible by 4, we need to find the smallest number m such that m is divisible by 4 and m >= 14.\n\nThen, the number of additional students needed is m - n.\n\nTo find m, we can use the ceiling function: m = ceil(n / t) * t.\n\nSo, ceil(14 / 4) = ceil(3.5) = 4, then m = 4 * 4 = 16.\n\nThus, 16 - 14 = 2.\n\nThis confirms my earlier thought.\n\nIs there any other way to interpret this problem? Maybe if we consider that teams can have different numbers of students, but the problem specifically says \"with the same number of students on each team.\" So, all teams must have an equal number.\n\nAlso, the problem is asking for \"how many more students would need to sign up,\" assuming that we can only add students, not remove any.\n\nSo, 2 is the minimal number of students that need to sign up to make the total divisible by 4.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a scenario where more students sign up, like 6 more, making it 20 students, which is also divisible by 4.\n\nBut the problem is asking for \"how many more students", "answer": "2", "equiv": false}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here about ants needing food to unblock their anthill so I can pass through. It says that the ants need 911 grains of food in total, and they already have 762 grains.

I just need to subtract the number of grains they already have from the total number they need. So, it's 911 minus 762.\n\nLet me write that down: 911 - 762.\n\nHmm, let's do this step by step. I'll start from the rightmost digit.\n\nFirst, subtract the units place: 1 minus 2. Hmm, 1 is less than 2, so I need to borrow from the tens place.\n\nThe tens place in 911 is 1. But if I borrow from it, it's actually 11 minus 2, which is 9. Then, the tens place becomes 0 because I borrowed 10 from it.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me try again.\n\nActually, in 911, the digits are hundreds, tens, and units: 9, 1, and 1.\n\nSo, starting from the units place:\n\n- Units: 1 - 2. Since 1 is less than 2, I need to borrow 1 from the tens place.\n\n- The tens place is 1, so borrowing 1 from it leaves it as 0, and the units become 11.\n\n- Now, 11 - 2 = 9.\n\n- Tens place is now 0, and I need to subtract 6 from it because 762 has 6 in the tens place.\n\n- 0 - 6. Again, 0 is less than 6, so I need to borrow from the hundreds place.\n\n- The hundreds place is 9, borrowing 1 from it leaves it as 8, and the tens place becomes 10.\n\n- Now, 10 - 6 = 4.\n\n- Hundreds place is now 8, and I need to subtract 7 from it.\n\n- 8 - 7 = 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 1 in the hundreds place, 4 in the tens place, and 9 in the units place. That makes 149.\n\nWait, but let me check that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting over:\n\n911 - 762.\n\n- Units: 1 - 2. Borrow from tens, so 11 - 2 = 9.\n\n- Tens: After borrowing, it's 0 - 6. Borrow from hundreds, so 10 - 6 = 4.\n\n- Hundreds: After borrowing, it's 8 - 7 = 1.\n\nSo, 149.\n\nLet me verify this by adding 762 and 149 to see if I get 911.\n\n762 + 149.\n\n- Units: 2 + 9 = 11. Write down 1, carry over 1.\n\n- Tens: 6 + 4 = 10, plus the carried over 1 is 11. Write down 1, carry over 1.\n\n- Hundreds: 7 + 1 = 8, plus the carried over 1 is 9.\n\nSo, 762 + 149 = 911. Perfect, that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the ants need to gather 149 more grains of food.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to look at this problem? Maybe using addition instead of subtraction?\n\nI could think about it as: they need 911 grains, have 762, so I need to find the difference.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how much more they need to reach 911 starting from 762.\n\nLet me try adding up from 762 to 911.\n\nFirst, from 762 to 800 is 38 grains (since 800 - 762 = 38).\n\nThen, from 800 to 900 is 100 grains.\n\nFinally, from 900 to 911 is 11 grains.\n\nNow, adding those up: 38 + 100 + 11.\n\n38 + 100 is 138, plus 11 is 149.\n\nAgain, I get 149 grains.\n\nOkay, so both methods give me the same answer, which is a good sign.\n\nIs there another way to confirm this?\n\nWell, I could use a different subtraction method, maybe subtracting in parts.\n\nFor example,", "answer": "149", "equiv": false}, {"output": "59", "answer": "59", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this math problem here. Sam has a really long ribbon, 3,730 centimeters long, and he cuts it into pieces that are each 73 centimeters long. The question is, after he's done cutting as many of these pieces as he can, how much of the original ribbon is left over?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. Sam is cutting the ribbon into equal lengths of 73 cm each, and I need to find out what's left after he's cut as many of those pieces as possible. That sounds like a division problem to me, where I divide the total length of the ribbon by the length of each piece.\n\nSo, total ribbon length is 3,730 cm, and each piece is 73 cm. I need to divide 3,730 by 73 to find out how many full pieces he can get, and then see if there's any remainder, which would be the leftover ribbon.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal ribbon length: 3,730 cm\n\nLength of each piece: 73 cm\n\nNumber of pieces: 3,730 \u00f7 73\n\nNow, I need to do this division. I'm a bit rusty on dividing large numbers, but I'll try my best.\n\nFirst, I'll see how many times 73 goes into 373, since 73 is a two-digit number and 3,730 has four digits.\n\n73 times 5 is 365, which is less than 373.\n\n73 times 6 is 438, which is too big because it's greater than 373.\n\nSo, 73 goes into 373 five times. 5 times 73 is 365.\n\nSubtract 365 from 373: 373 - 365 = 8.\n\nNow, bring down the next digit, which is 0, making it 80.\n\nNow, how many times does 73 go into 80?\n\n73 times 1 is 73, which is less than 80.\n\n73 times 2 is 146, which is too big.\n\nSo, 73 goes into 80 once. 1 times 73 is 73.\n\nSubtract 73 from 80: 80 - 73 = 7.\n\nThere are no more digits to bring down, so the division process ends here.\n\nSo, the quotient is 51, and the remainder is 7.\n\nWait, let me check that again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nTotal length: 3,730 cm\n\nDivide by: 73 cm\n\n73 times 50 is 3,650.\n\nSubtract 3,650 from 3,730: 3,730 - 3,650 = 80.\n\nThen, 73 goes into 80 once, giving 73.\n\nSubtract 73 from 80: 80 - 73 = 7.\n\nSo, yes, the remainder is 7 cm.\n\nTherefore, after cutting as many 73 cm pieces as possible, there are 7 cm of ribbon left.\n\nWait a minute, I should double-check my division to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n51 times 73 should be equal to 3,723.\n\nBecause 50 times 73 is 3,650, and 1 times 73 is 73.\n\nAdding those together: 3,650 + 73 = 3,723.\n\nNow, subtract 3,723 from 3,730: 3,730 - 3,723 = 7.\n\nYes, that matches the remainder I got earlier.\n\nSo, the leftover ribbon is 7 cm.\n\nI think that's the answer, but let me consider if there's another way to approach this problem.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the modulo operation, which directly gives the remainder when one number is divided by another.\n\nSo, 3,730 modulo 73 should give me the remainder, which is what I'm looking for.\n\nUsing a calculator, if I input 3,730 mod 73, it should give me 7, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I don't have a calculator, I can rely on the long division method I used earlier.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nIs there any other way to check this?\n\nWell, I could see how many 73 cm pieces fit into 3,730 cm.\n\nNumber of pieces = 3,730", "answer": "7", "equiv": false}, {"output": "12", "answer": "12", "equiv": true}, {"output": "78", "answer": "78", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here. Two people are walking together, and their steps measure 75 cm and 90 cm respectively. I need to find out the minimum distance they should walk so that both can cover the same distance in complete steps. Hmm, that sounds like I need to find a common multiple of their step lengths.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a multiple is. A multiple of a number is what you get when you multiply that number by any whole number. So, for example, multiples of 75 would be 75, 150, 225, 300, and so on, depending on what you multiply 75 by.\n\nSimilarly, multiples of 90 would be 90, 180, 270, 360, and so forth.\n\nNow, I need to find a distance where both can complete their steps without having to take a partial step. That means the distance should be a multiple of both 75 and 90.\n\nThe smallest such distance would be the least common multiple (LCM) of 75 and 90. LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.\n\nTo find the LCM of two numbers, I can use the formula that involves their greatest common divisor (GCD). The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a,b) = \\frac{a \\times b}{\\text{GCD}(a,b)} \\]\n\nSo, I need to find the GCD of 75 and 90 first.\n\nLet's find the GCD of 75 and 90.\n\nI can list the factors of each number and find the highest common factor.\n\nFactors of 75: 1, 3, 5, 15, 25, 75.\n\nFactors of 90: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90.\n\nThe common factors are 1, 3, 5, and 15. The greatest among these is 15.\n\nSo, GCD(75,90) = 15.\n\nNow, plugging back into the LCM formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(75,90) = \\frac{75 \\times 90}{15} \\]\n\nFirst, multiply 75 and 90:\n\n75 \u00d7 90 = 6750.\n\nThen, divide that by their GCD, which is 15:\n\n6750 \u00f7 15 = 450.\n\nSo, the LCM of 75 and 90 is 450.\n\nTherefore, the minimum distance they should walk so that both can cover the same distance in complete steps is 450 cm.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that.\n\nIf one person has a step length of 75 cm, then the number of steps they would take to cover 450 cm is 450 \u00f7 75 = 6 steps.\n\nThe other person has a step length of 90 cm, so they would take 450 \u00f7 90 = 5 steps.\n\nBoth are covering 450 cm with a whole number of steps, which checks out.\n\nIs there a smaller distance than 450 cm where this would happen?\n\nLet's see, is there a common multiple of 75 and 90 that is smaller than 450 cm?\n\nLooking at the multiples:\n\nMultiples of 75: 75, 150, 225, 300, 375, 450, etc.\n\nMultiples of 90: 90, 180, 270, 360, 450, etc.\n\nThe smallest common multiple is indeed 450 cm.\n\nSo, my answer should be 450 cm.\n\nBut, maybe I should consider if there's a smaller distance where both could walk a whole number of steps.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe there's a smaller distance if I consider the steps they take together.\n\nBut no, the LCM approach seems correct. It's the standard method for finding the smallest distance where both can synchronize their steps.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of the least common multiple of their step lengths.\n\nYes, that's what I did.\n\nSo, I think 450 cm is the correct answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I should convert it to meters to make it more standard.\n\nSince 100 cm is 1 meter, then 450 cm is 4.5 meters.\n\nBut the problem asked for the distance in cm, so ", "answer": "450", "equiv": false}, {"output": "So I have this problem here: Laverne has 20 baseballs and 15 basketballs. She wants to divide them into identical groups without any balls left over. I need to find out the greatest number of groups she can make.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to divide them into identical groups. That means each group should have the same number of baseballs and the same number of basketballs.\n\nSo, I need to find a number that can divide both 20 and 15 evenly, because that number will represent the number of groups.\n\nWait, but actually, I think I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 15. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. That should give me the greatest number of identical groups.\n\nLet me verify that thought. If I find the GCD of 20 and 15, and it's, say, 5, then I can make 5 groups, each with 20 \u00f7 5 = 4 baseballs and 15 \u00f7 5 = 3 basketballs.\n\nThat seems right. So, the GCD of 20 and 15 is what I'm looking for.\n\nNow, how do I find the GCD of 20 and 15?\n\nOne way is to list the factors of each number and find the largest common factor.\n\nFactors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20\n\nFactors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15\n\nCommon factors: 1, 5\n\nSo, the greatest common factor is 5.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of identical groups Laverne can make is 5.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check.\n\nIf she makes 5 groups, each group would have 4 baseballs and 3 basketballs, since 20 \u00f7 5 = 4 and 15 \u00f7 5 = 3.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nIs there another way to approach this problem?\n\nMaybe using prime factorization.\n\nThe prime factorization of 20 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5.\n\nThe prime factorization of 15 is 3 \u00d7 5.\n\nThe common prime factor is 5, so the GCD is 5.\n\nSame result as before.\n\nOkay, that reinforces my answer.\n\nIs there any other method I can use to confirm?\n\nPerhaps the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller number and then replacing the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder, and repeating this until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nSo, 20 divided by 15 is 1 with a remainder of 5.\n\nThen, 15 divided by 5 is 3 with a remainder of 0.\n\nSo, the GCD is 5.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlright, it seems consistent across different methods.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem?\n\nSuppose I try to divide the balls into more than 5 groups. Let's say 6 groups.\n\nThen, each group would have 20 \u00f7 6 \u2248 3.333 baseballs and 15 \u00f7 6 = 2.5 basketballs.\n\nBut I can't have a fraction of a ball, so that's not possible. There would be leftover balls.\n\nSimilarly, if I try 4 groups, 20 \u00f7 4 = 5 baseballs and 15 \u00f7 4 = 3.75 basketballs, which again isn't whole numbers.\n\nWait, but 15 \u00f7 4 is 3.75, meaning there would be leftover basketballs.\n\nBut if I stick with 5 groups, everything divides evenly.\n\nSo, 5 seems to be the greatest number of groups possible without leftovers.\n\nLet me consider if there's a smaller number of groups that still divides evenly.\n\nFor example, 1 group: that's trivial, but we're looking for the greatest number beyond that.\n\n2 groups: 20 \u00f7 2 = 10 baseballs and 15 \u00f7 2 = 7.5 basketballs.

The problem says: \"One-third of a certain number added with one-fifth gives eight-fifteenth of the number.

Specifically, it mentions one-third of the number, one-fifth of something, and eight-fifteenths of the number. I need to find what this number is.\n\nLet me denote the unknown number as \\( n \\). So, one-third of the number is \\( \\frac{1}{3}n \\), and one-fifth is \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\). Wait, one-fifth of what? The problem says \"one-third of a certain number added with one-fifth gives eight-fifteen of the number.\" Hmm, it's a bit ambiguous whether \"one-fifth\" refers to one-fifth of the number or just one-fifth added to one-third of the number.\n\nI think it's clearer to interpret it as one-third of the number added to one-fifth of the number equals eight-fifteenths of the number. So, both one-third and one-fifth are applied to the same number \\( n \\), and their sum equals eight-fifteenths of \\( n \\).\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}n + \\frac{1}{5}n = \\frac{8}{15}n\n\\]\n\nIs that correct? Let me double-check the problem statement: \"One-third of a certain number added with one-fifth gives eight-fifteenths of the number.\" Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( n \\). But wait, when I look at the equation, it seems like it holds for any \\( n \\), because it's all in terms of \\( n \\). Let me see:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}n + \\frac{1}{5}n = \\left( \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} \\right)n = \\left( \\frac{5 + 3}{15} \\right)n = \\frac{8}{15}n\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{8}{15}n = \\frac{8}{15}n\\). This is always true for any \\( n \\). Hmm, that can't be right because it suggests that any number satisfies this equation, but the problem is asking to find a specific number. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"One-third of a certain number added with one-fifth gives eight-fifteenths of the number.\" Perhaps it's not one-fifth of the number being added, but just one-fifth added to one-third of the number. So, it's one-third of the number plus one-fifth (a constant one-fifth, not one-fifth of the number) equals eight-fifteenths of the number.\n\nSo, the equation should be:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}n + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{8}{15}n\n\\]\n\nThat makes more sense. Now, I need to solve for \\( n \\) in this equation.\n\nFirst, I'll get all terms involving \\( n \\) on one side and constants on the other. Let's subtract \\(\\frac{1}{3}n\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{8}{15}n - \\frac{1}{3}n\n\\]\n\nTo combine the \\( n \\) terms, I need a common denominator. The common denominator for 15 and 3 is 15.\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{1}{3}n = \\frac{5}{15}n\\).\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{5} = \\left( \\frac{8}{15} - \\frac{5}{15} \\right)n = \\frac{3}{15}n = \\frac{1}{5}n\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(\\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{5}n\\).\n\nNow, to solve for \\( n \\), I can multiply both sides by 5:\n\n\\[\n1 = n\n\\]\n\nWait, is that right?

He wants the total number of AA batteries to equal the total number of D batteries.\n\nLet me think about this. If he buys one pack of AA batteries, that's 38 AA batteries, and one pack of D batteries, that's 44 D batteries. But 38 isn't equal to 44, so that doesn't work. He needs to buy multiple packs to make the totals equal.\n\nSo, if he buys x packs of AA batteries and y packs of D batteries, then the total number of AA batteries would be 38x, and the total number of D batteries would be 44y.

If he has, say, 10 pieces, then each bag would have 5. Or if he has 8 pieces, each bag would have 4. But with 9 pieces, if he tries to split them into 2 bags, one bag would have 4 and the other would have 5, which aren't equal.\n\nSo, to make them equal, he needs a number that is divisible by 2 without any remainder.

So, the total number of candies needs to be divisible by 2.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total number of candies he needs as n, where n is divisible by 2.\n\nHe currently has 9 candies, so he needs n - 9 more candies.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest n that is greater than or equal to 9 and divisible by 2, and then find n - 9.\n\nSo, what's the smallest even number that's greater than or equal to 9?\n\nWell, 9 is odd, so the next even number is 10.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about dividing 9 by 2 and seeing what the remainder is.\n\nWhen you divide 9 by 2, you get 4 with a remainder of 1.\n\nThis remainder means there's 1 piece left over that can't be paired into the two bags equally.\n\nTo make it evenly divisible, he needs enough pieces to make the remainder zero.\n\nSo, he needs to add enough pieces to make the remainder zero.\n\nSince the remainder is 1, he needs to add 1 piece to make the total 10, which divides evenly by 2.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the modulus operation.\n\n9 mod 2 = 1, which is not zero.\n\nTo make 9 mod 2 = 0, he needs to add 1, because 10 mod 2 = 0.\n\nSo, he needs to add 1 piece.\n\nBut let's think about it another way. Maybe he needs to have multiple of 2 bags.\n\nWait, no, he's only splitting into 2 bags. So, the total needs to be divisible by 2.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see what the difference is between 9 and the nearest even number that's greater than or equal to 9.\n\nAgain, that's 10.\n\nSo, 10 - 9 = 1.\n\nTherefore, he needs 1 more piece.\n\nWait, but maybe he needs to have more than just 10. Maybe there's a general formula for this.\n\nLet\u2019s think about a general case.\n\nIf he has k pieces of candy and wants to split them into m bags with equal amounts, how many more pieces does he need?\n\nIn this case, k = 9 and m = 2.\n\nSo, in general, he needs to find the smallest n >= k such that n is divisible by m.\n\nThen, the number of additional pieces needed is n - k.\n\nIn this specific case, k = 9 and m = 2.\n\nSo, we need the smallest n >= 9 such that n mod 2 = 0.\n\nWhich, as we said, is 10.\n\nSo, n = 10, and n - k = 10 - 9 = 1.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the remainder when k is divided by m.\n\nLet r = k mod m.\n\nIf r = 0, then he doesn't need any more pieces.\n\nIf r != 0, then he needs m - r pieces to make it divisible by m.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nk = 9, m = 2.\n\nr = 9 mod 2 = 1.\n\nThen, m - r = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nSo, he needs 1 more piece.\n\n", "answer": "1", "equiv": false}, {"output": "5", "answer": "5", "equiv": true}, {"output": "69", "answer": "69", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So Kim wants to buy a watch that costs $87.60, and she gives the cashier $100. I need to figure out how much change she should get back. Okay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to subtract the cost of the watch from the amount Kim gave to the cashier. So, it's $100 minus $87.60. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on subtracting decimals, but I think I can handle it.\n\nLet me write this down to make it clearer. So, I have:\n\n$100.00\n\n- $87.60\n\n__________\n\nNow, I need to subtract these amounts. Starting from the rightmost digit, which is the hundredths place. 0 minus 0 is 0. Next, the tenths place: 0 minus 6. Oh, wait, I can't do 0 minus 6 because 0 is smaller than 6. So, I need to borrow from the dollars place.\n\nLet's see, $100.00 is the same as 99 dollars and 100 cents, I think. Wait, maybe I should think of it as $99 + $1.00, and then $1.00 is 100 cents. So, $99 and 100 cents minus $87 and 60 cents.\n\nAlternatively, I can align the decimal points and borrow properly. Let me try that.\n\nSo, starting again:\n\n$100.00\n\n- $87.60\n\n__________\n\nFrom the hundredths place: 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nFrom the tenths place: 0 - 6. Can't do that, so I need to borrow 1 from the dollars place. But wait, the dollars place is 00. So, I need to borrow from the hundreds place.\n\n$100 is the same as $99 + $1.00. So, I can think of it as $99 and 100 cents minus $87 and 60 cents.\n\nSo, $99 - $87 = $12.\n\nAnd 100 cents - 60 cents = 40 cents.\n\nSo, total change is $12 and 40 cents, which is $12.40.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of cents entirely. $100 is 10,000 cents, and $87.60 is 8760 cents. So, 10,000 - 8760 = 1240 cents. Then, 1240 cents is $12.40.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier. Good, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to check is to add the cost of the watch and the change to see if it equals $100. So, $87.60 + $12.40 = $100.00. Yes, that checks out.\n\nSo, Kim should receive $12.40 in change.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about the decimal places. In $12.40, the 4 is in the tenths place, and 0 is in the hundredths. Is that correct?\n\nLet me verify again. $87.60 plus $12.40 equals $100.00. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in money terms. If the watch costs $87.60 and she gives $100, the difference should be $12.40.\n\nLet me consider breaking it down:\n\n- From $87.60, adding $2.40 would bring it to $90.00.\n\n- Then, from $90.00, adding $10.00 brings it to $100.00.\n\n- So, $2.40 + $10.00 = $12.40.\n\nThat's another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I could have subtracted step by step:\n\n- Subtract $80 from $100, which leaves $20.\n\n- Then subtract $7.60 from $20.00.\n\n- $20.00 - $7.60.\n\n- $20.00 - $7.00 = $13.00.\n\n- Then, $13.00 - $0.60 = $12.40.\n\nAgain, the same result.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough ways.

Barbara ate 59 Atomic Fireballs. How many Atomic Fireballs does she have left?\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems like Barbara had some Atomic Fireballs to start with, she ate 59 of them, and now I need to find out how many she has left. But the problem doesn't specify how many she had initially. It only says that they come in packages of 9.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to assume that she bought a certain number of packages. But without knowing how many packages she bought, I can't determine the exact number she has left. Wait, perhaps the problem is implying that she bought just one package, which is 9 fireballs, and then ate 59. But that doesn't make sense because she couldn't eat 59 if she only had 9 to begin with.\n\nMaybe I'm misinterpreting something. Let me read the problem again: \"Atomic Fireballs come in packages of 9. Barbara ate 59 Atomic Fireballs. How many Atomic Fireballs does she have left?\"\n\nAh, maybe it's a division problem where I need to see how many full packages are in 59 fireballs and then see the remainder. But that seems off because she ate 59, and packages are of 9, but it's not clear what her initial amount was.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about how many packages she consumed to eat 59 fireballs, given that each package has 9. But again, without knowing the initial number of packages or fireballs she had, I can't determine how many she has left.\n\nMaybe I need to approach it differently. If she ate 59 fireballs, and they come in packages of 9, perhaps I need to find out how many packages that would be and if there's a remainder.\n\nLet me try dividing 59 by 9.\n\n59 \u00f7 9 = 6 with a remainder of 5, because 9 times 6 is 54, and 59 minus 54 is 5.\n\nSo, she ate 6 full packages plus 5 individual fireballs.\n\nBut again, without knowing her initial amount, I can't determine how many she has left.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the problem is assuming that she only bought one package of 9, but she ate 59, which is more than one package. That doesn't make sense because she couldn't eat more than she had unless she bought more packages.\n\nPerhaps I need to think about it in terms of total fireballs consumed and packages.\n\nLet me consider that each package has 9 fireballs, and she ate 59 fireballs. If she bought p packages, then she had 9p fireballs initially. She ate 59, so the remaining fireballs would be 9p - 59.\n\nBut without knowing p, I can't find a numerical answer.\n\nUnless, maybe, the problem expects me to express the answer in terms of p, but that seems unlikely because the question is asking for a specific number of fireballs left.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem itself, and it should have specified how many packages she bought initially.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about finding the smallest number of packages she could have bought to have at least 59 fireballs, and then find out how many are left.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the smallest p such that 9p \u2265 59.\n\nTo find p, I can divide 59 by 9.\n\n59 \u00f7 9 = 6.555..., so she needs to buy at least 7 packages to have enough fireballs.\n\n7 packages would give her 63 fireballs.\n\nIf she ate 59, then she would have 63 - 59 = 4 left.\n\nWait, but earlier when I divided 59 by 9, I got 6 with a remainder of 5, meaning she ate 6 packages and 5 individual fireballs.\n\nIf she bought 7 packages, that's 63 fireballs, and after eating 59, she has 4 left.\n\nBut perhaps she bought more than 7 packages.\n\nIf she bought 8 packages, that's 72 fireballs. She ate 59, so she has 72 - 59 = 13 left.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how many packages she bought, so there isn't a unique answer unless I assume she bought the smallest number possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is worded incorrectly, and it should have said something like \"Barbara had some Atomic Fireballs coming in packages of 9.

The numbers are: 45 in the first bag, 53 in the second, 61 in the third, and 69 in the fourth. The question is, if this pattern continues, how many bottles will she put in the fifth bag?\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to figure out what the pattern is. Let's look at the numbers again:\n\n- 1st bag: 45\n\n- 2nd bag: 53\n\n- 3rd bag: 61\n\n- 4th bag: 69\n\nI need to see how much she's increasing by each time. So, let's calculate the difference between consecutive bags.\n\nFrom the 1st to the 2nd bag: 53 - 45 = 8\n\nFrom the 2nd to the 3rd bag: 61 - 53 = 8\n\nFrom the 3rd to the 4th bag: 69 - 61 = 8\n\nHmm, looks like she's adding 8 bottles each time. So, if this pattern continues, I should add another 8 to get the number for the fifth bag.\n\nSo, 69 + 8 = 77\n\nWait, is that it? It seems pretty straightforward, but maybe I should check if there's another pattern I'm missing. Maybe the pattern isn't just adding 8 each time. Maybe there's a different way to look at it.\n\nLet me see if there's a formula or something. If I consider the bag number as n, starting from 1, and the number of bottles as a function of n, maybe I can find a general formula.\n\nSo, for n=1, bottles=45\n\nn=2, bottles=53\n\nn=3, bottles=61\n\nn=4, bottles=69\n\nIf it's an arithmetic sequence, the difference between terms is constant, which seems to be 8, as I saw earlier.\n\nThe general formula for an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nbottles = initial term + (n - 1) * common difference\n\nSo, bottles = 45 + (n - 1) * 8\n\nLet me verify this with the given terms.\n\nFor n=1: 45 + (1-1)*8 = 45 + 0 = 45 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: 45 + (2-1)*8 = 45 + 8 = 53 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: 45 + (3-1)*8 = 45 + 16 = 61 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: 45 + (4-1)*8 = 45 + 24 = 69 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nGreat, so the formula seems to hold for the given terms. Now, to find out how many bottles are in the fifth bag, I can plug in n=5.\n\nbottles = 45 + (5-1)*8 = 45 + 4*8 = 45 + 32 = 77\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier just by adding 8.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe a different type of sequence, like geometric or something else, but given that the differences are constant, it's probably arithmetic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the digits themselves. Let's look at the numbers again:\n\n45, 53, 61, 69\n\nLooking at the units digit:\n\n5, 3, 1, 9\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem to have a straightforward pattern. Maybe it's just coincidental.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the tens digit:\n\n4, 5, 6, 6\n\nWait, 4, 5, 6, 6... that doesn't seem consistent. Oh, wait, 69 has 6 in the tens place, but maybe I need to think differently.\n\nI think sticking with the arithmetic sequence is the way to go. It's consistent, and the pattern of adding 8 each time makes sense.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can plot these points.

There's a pot with 1,050 milliliters of tea, and Anna pours it into some cups, each containing 65 milliliters. I need to find out how much tea is left in the pot after she's done pouring.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many cups Anna can fill with the tea in the pot. Since each cup holds 65 ml, I can divide the total amount of tea by the amount per cup to find out how many cups she can fill.\n\nSo, 1,050 divided by 65. Let me do that calculation.\n\n1,050 \u00f7 65.\n\nWell, 65 times 16 is 1,040, because 65 times 10 is 650, and 65 times 6 is 390. Add those together: 650 + 390 = 1,040.\n\nSo, 65 times 16 is 1,040, which is 10 less than 1,050. That means she can fill 16 cups completely, and there will be some tea left over.\n\nTo find out how much tea is left, I can subtract the total amount poured into the cups from the original amount.\n\nFirst, find out how much tea was poured into the 16 cups.\n\n65 ml per cup times 16 cups is 1,040 ml.\n\nNow, subtract that from the original 1,050 ml.\n\n1,050 ml - 1,040 ml = 10 ml.\n\nSo, there are 10 ml of tea left in the pot.\n\nWait a minute, is there a better way to do this? Maybe using division and finding the remainder?\n\nYes, that's essentially what I did, but maybe I can think of it in terms of division with a remainder.\n\nSo, 1,050 divided by 65 is 16 with a remainder of 10.\n\nThat means she can fill 16 cups, and there's 10 ml left over.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the division formula:\n\nDividend = (Divisor \u00d7 Quotient) + Remainder.\n\nIn this case, the dividend is 1,050 (total tea), the divisor is 65 (tea per cup), the quotient is 16 (number of cups), and the remainder is 10 (tea left over).\n\nSo, 1,050 = (65 \u00d7 16) + 10.\n\nLet me check that:\n\n65 \u00d7 16 = 1,040.\n\n1,040 + 10 = 1,050.\n\nPerfect, that checks out.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using proportions or something else?\n\nWell, since it's a straightforward division problem, I think the method I used is the most efficient.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's a way to use equations here.\n\nLet\u2019s say let x be the number of cups filled, and each cup has 65 ml, so the total tea used is 65x ml.\n\nThe tea left in the pot is 1,050 - 65x.\n\nWe need to find the maximum whole number x such that 65x \u2264 1,050.\n\nWe already know that x = 16, and 65 \u00d7 16 = 1,040, which is less than or equal to 1,050.\n\nAnd 65 \u00d7 17 = 1,105, which is more than 1,050, so x cannot be 17.\n\nTherefore, x = 16, and the tea left is 1,050 - 1,040 = 10 ml.\n\nThis confirms our earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use algebra, I could set up the equation:\n\nTea left = 1,050 - 65x,\n\nAnd since x is the number of cups, and it has to be a whole number, I can find x such that tea left is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nSo, 1,050 - 65x \u2265 0.\n\nSolving for x:\n\n65x \u2264 1,050.\n\nx \u2264 1,050 / 65.\n\n1,050 \u00f7 65 is approximately 16.1538.\n\nSince x has to be a whole number, x = 16.\n\nThen, tea left = 1,050 - 65 \u00d7 16 = 1,05", "answer": "10", "equiv": false}, {"output": "98", "answer": "98", "equiv": true}, {"output": "27", "answer": "27", "equiv": true}, {"output": "21", "answer": "21", "equiv": true}, {"output": "112", "answer": "112", "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": "9", "equiv": false}, {"output": "30 \\text{ meters}", "answer": "30", "equiv": false}, {"output": "29", "answer": "29", "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": "8", "equiv": true}, {"output": "12", "answer": "12", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this problem here: A worker needs to cut a 27-yard long rope into some long pieces that are each 4 yards long and some short pieces that are each 1 yard long.

The total length of the rope is 27 yards, and it needs to be divided into pieces that are either 4 yards or 1 yard long. The objective is to have the fewest number of pieces overall. So, I should aim to maximize the number of long pieces because each long piece is longer and will reduce the total number of pieces.\n\nLet me think about it mathematically. Let\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( L \\) as the number of long pieces (each 4 yards)\n\n- \\( S \\) as the number of short pieces (each 1 yard)\n\nThe total length equation would be:\n\n\\[ 4L + S = 27 \\]\n\nAnd the total number of pieces is:\n\n\\[ L + S \\]\n\nI need to minimize \\( L + S \\), given the constraint \\( 4L + S = 27 \\).\n\nFrom the total length equation, I can express \\( S \\) in terms of \\( L \\):\n\n\\[ S = 27 - 4L \\]\n\nNow, substitute this into the total pieces equation:\n\n\\[ L + S = L + (27 - 4L) = 27 - 3L \\]\n\nSo, the total number of pieces is \\( 27 - 3L \\). To minimize this, I need to maximize \\( L \\), because the more long pieces I have, the fewer pieces overall.\n\nHowever, there's a constraint here: \\( L \\) has to be an integer because you can't have a fraction of a piece, and \\( S \\) also has to be a non-negative integer because you can't have negative pieces.\n\nSo, I need to find the maximum integer value of \\( L \\) such that \\( S = 27 - 4L \\) is non-negative.\n\nLet's solve for \\( L \\):\n\n\\[ 27 - 4L \\geq 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 4L \\leq 27 \\]\n\n\\[ L \\leq \\frac{27}{4} \\]\n\n\\[ L \\leq 6.75 \\]\n\nSince \\( L \\) must be an integer, the maximum possible value for \\( L \\) is 6.\n\nLet me check if \\( L = 6 \\) works:\n\n\\[ S = 27 - 4(6) = 27 - 24 = 3 \\]\n\nSo, \\( S = 3 \\), which is non-negative.\n\nNow, let's see how many total pieces that would be:\n\n\\[ L + S = 6 + 3 = 9 \\]\n\nIs there a way to have fewer than 9 pieces? Let's see what happens if I increase \\( L \\) beyond 6. But wait, \\( L \\) can't be more than 6 because \\( L \\leq 6 \\).\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if there's a smaller number of pieces possible with a different combination.\n\nLet me consider \\( L = 5 \\):\n\n\\[ S = 27 - 4(5) = 27 - 20 = 7 \\]\n\nTotal pieces: \\( 5 + 7 = 12 \\), which is more than 9.\n\nWhat about \\( L = 7 \\):\n\n\\[ S = 27 - 4(7) = 27 - 28 = -1 \\]\n\nNegative \\( S \\) doesn't make sense, so \\( L = 7 \\) is invalid.\n\nTherefore, \\( L = 6 \\) with \\( S = 3 \\) gives the fewest pieces, which is 9.\n\nWait, but I thought about maximizing \\( L \\) to minimize pieces, but maybe there's a smarter way. Perhaps using some long pieces and some short pieces in a different combination could lead to fewer pieces.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose I use as many long pieces as possible, but consider if using fewer long pieces could result in fewer total pieces.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Using more long pieces should lead to fewer total pieces because each long piece covers more length.\n\nLet me consider the general case. The total number of pieces is \\( L + S = L + (27 - 4L) = 27 - 3L \\). This is a linear function where the number of pieces decreases as \\( L \\) increases, as long as \\( S \\) remains non-negative.\n\nTherefore, to minimize \\( L + S \\), I need to maximize \\( L \\), given that \\( S \\) is non-negative.\n\nFrom earlier,", "answer": "6", "equiv": false}, {"output": "25", "answer": "25", "equiv": true}, {"output": "729", "answer": "729", "equiv": true}, {"output": "47", "answer": "47", "equiv": true}, {"output": "244", "answer": "244", "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": "8", "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": "8", "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": "6", "equiv": true}, {"output": "95", "answer": "95", "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": "2", "equiv": true}, {"output": "32", "answer": "32", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here.

That should give me the maximum number of groups possible where each group has the same number of girls and boys.\n\nLet me list the divisors of 16 and 8.\n\nThe divisors of 16 are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.\n\nThe divisors of 8 are: 1, 2, 4, 8.\n\nNow, the common divisors of both 16 and 8 are: 1, 2, 4, 8.\n\nSo, the greatest common divisor is 8.\n\nWait a minute, but if I make 8 groups, how many girls and boys would be in each group?\n\nIf there are 16 girls divided into 8 groups, that's 16 / 8 = 2 girls per group.\n\nAnd 8 boys divided into 8 groups, that's 8 / 8 = 1 boy per group.\n\nSo, each group would have 2 girls and 1 boy. And no one is left out. That seems to work.\n\nBut let me check if there's a larger number of groups possible. Wait, the GCD is 8, and that's the greatest number that divides both 16 and 8. So, 8 should be the maximum number of groups.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's try with another number. Suppose I try 4 groups.\n\nWith 4 groups, 16 girls divided by 4 is 4 girls per group.\n\n8 boys divided by 4 is 2 boys per group.\n\nSo, each group would have 4 girls and 2 boys. That also works, but it's fewer groups.\n\nSimilarly, if I do 2 groups, it would be 8 girls and 4 boys per group.\n\nAnd with 1 group, it's all 16 girls and 8 boys.\n\nBut the question is asking for the greatest number of groups, so 8 is the answer.\n\nWait, but I should confirm if there's any restriction that I might have missed.\n\nThe problem says \"each group containing the same combination of girls and boys\" and \"no one is left out.\"\n\nI think I've covered that by ensuring that the number of groups is a common divisor of both the number of girls and boys.\n\nIs there any other constraint here?\n\nAlso, the problem mentions \"the same combination of girls and boys.\" Does that imply that the ratio of girls to boys should be the same in each group?\n\nWell, in my earlier approach, the ratio would be the same because each group has the same number of girls and the same number of boys.\n\nBut perhaps I should think in terms of ratios.\n\nIf I consider the ratio of girls to boys in the entire club, it's 16:8, which simplifies to 2:1.\n\nSo, in each group, the ratio should be 2:1.\n\nSo, in each group, there should be twice as many girls as boys.\n\nIn my earlier approach, with 8 groups, each having 2 girls and 1 boy, that matches the ratio.\n\nWith 4 groups, each having 4 girls and 2 boys, which is still 2:1.\n\nSimilarly, 2 groups with 8 girls and 4 boys, still 2:1.\n\nAnd 1 group with 16 girls and 8 boys, again 2:1.\n\nSo, all these options maintain the ratio.\n\nBut the question is asking for the greatest number of groups, which would be 8.\n\nBut let me see if there's a mathematical way to find this without listing all the divisors.\n\nYes, using the GCD is the efficient way.\n\nSo, GCD of 16 and 8 is 8.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of groups is 8.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about it in terms", "answer": "8", "equiv": false}, {"output": "So I've got this math problem here. It says that the difference of two numbers is 100, and one of the numbers is 91. I need to find the other number. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"difference\" means in this context. In math, the difference between two numbers is basically how much one number differs from the other. It's usually found by subtracting one number from the other. So, if I have two numbers, let's say x and y, their difference is x - y or y - x, depending on which one is bigger.\n\nIn this problem, it says the difference is 100, and one of the numbers is 91. So, I need to find the other number that, when subtracted from 91 or vice versa, gives me a difference of 100.\n\nLet me think about this. If I have x - 91 = 100, then x would be 100 + 91, which is 191. That's one possibility.\n\nBut wait, difference could also be 91 - x = 100. Let's see what that gives me. If 91 - x = 100, then x = 91 - 100, which is -9. So, another possibility is that the other number is -9.\n\nHmm, so there are two possible answers: 191 or -9. Which one is correct?\n\nI need to check the problem again. It just says \"the difference of two numbers is 100, and one of the numbers is 91.\" It doesn't specify which one is larger or anything like that. So, both possibilities could be correct.\n\nLet me verify this. If I take 191 and 91, their difference is 191 - 91 = 100, which matches the problem. And if I take -9 and 91, their difference is 91 - (-9) = 91 + 9 = 100, which also matches.\n\nSo, both 191 and -9 are possible answers. But the problem says \"find the other number,\" which might imply there's only one answer. Maybe I need to consider the context or see if there's any other information that can help me decide.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects both possibilities. Let me see.\n\nIn some math problems, difference refers to the absolute difference, meaning the positive difference regardless of order. In that case, |x - 91| = 100. That would give me two equations: x - 91 = 100 or x - 91 = -100.\n\nSolving x - 91 = 100 gives x = 191, and x - 91 = -100 gives x = -9. So, again, both 191 and -9 are solutions.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify absolute difference; it just says difference. In general, difference means the result of subtraction, which can be positive or negative depending on the order.\n\nGiven that, both 191 and -9 are valid solutions. However, in many real-world contexts, difference is considered as a positive value. If that's the case here, then both answers are acceptable.\n\nBut to be safe, I should consider if there's any other information that can help me choose between the two. The problem doesn't provide any additional constraints, so perhaps both are acceptable answers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to consider only positive numbers, in which case 191 would be the answer.\n\nWait, the problem says \"two numbers,\" it doesn't specify whether they are positive or negative. So, both answers are mathematically correct.\n\nI think the best approach is to consider both possibilities and present them as the possible answers.\n\nSo, the other number could be 191 or -9.\n\nBut since the problem says \"find the other number,\" perhaps it expects a single answer. Maybe I need to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the context in which the numbers are used. For example, if they are measuring some physical quantity, negative numbers might not make sense. But since no context is provided, both answers are valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have only one solution, and I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet me consider another approach. If I let the other number be x, then the difference between x and 91 is 100. So, |x - 91| = 100.\n\nSolving this equation:\n\nCase 1: x - 91 = 100 \u21d2 x = 191\n\nCase 2: x - 91 = -100 \u21d2", "answer": "191", "equiv": false}, {"output": "5", "answer": "5", "equiv": true}, {"output": "35", "answer": "35", "equiv": true}, {"output": "7\\text{ meters}", "answer": "7", "equiv": false}, {"output": "2", "answer": "2", "equiv": true}, {"output": "32", "answer": "32", "equiv": true}, {"output": "84", "answer": "84", "equiv": true}, {"output": "56", "answer": "56", "equiv": true}, {"output": "18", "answer": "18", "equiv": true}, {"output": "70", "answer": "70", "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": "1", "equiv": true}, {"output": "Okay, so I have this problem here: Dave earned $53.90, and Sara earned $39.33. I need to find out how much more money Dave earned than Sara. It seems like a straightforward subtraction problem, right? I just need to subtract Sara's earnings from Dave's earnings.\n\nBut let me make sure I understand what's being asked. It's not just about subtracting the two amounts; I need to find the difference between what Dave earned and what Sara earned. So, indeed, subtraction is the way to go.\n\nFirst, I should write down the amounts clearly:\n\nDave: $53.90\n\nSara: $39.33\n\nNow, to find out how much more Dave earned than Sara, I'll subtract Sara's earnings from Dave's earnings:\n\n$53.90 - $39.33\n\nLet me make sure I align the decimal points correctly. Decimals can be tricky if they're not aligned properly.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\n  53.90\n\n- 39.33\n\n---------\n\nNow, subtracting starting from the right:\n\nFirst, 0 - 3. Well, I can't subtract 3 from 0, so I need to borrow from the left. But there's a 9 just to the left of the 0, in the tenths place. So, I can borrow 1 from the 9, making it 8, and the 0 becomes 10.\n\nNow, 10 - 3 = 7.\n\nNext, in the tenths place: 8 - 3 = 5.\n\nThen, in the units place: 3 - 9. Again, I can't subtract 9 from 3, so I need to borrow from the tens place. The 5 in the tens place becomes 4, and the 3 in the units place becomes 13.\n\nNow, 13 - 9 = 4.\n\nFinally, in the tens place: 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n  53.90\n\n- 39.33\n\n---------\n\n  14.57\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my subtraction again.\n\nLet me try subtracting again:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n0 - 3: can't do that, so borrow 1 from the tenths place. The 9 becomes 8, and the 0 becomes 10.\n\n10 - 3 = 7.\n\nNext, 8 - 3 = 5.\n\nNow, in the units place: 3 - 9. Can't do that, so borrow 1 from the tens place. The 5 becomes 4, and the 3 becomes 13.\n\n13 - 9 = 4.\n\nFinally, in the tens place: 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nSo, the result is $14.57.\n\nBut let me verify this by adding Sara's earnings back to the difference to see if I get Dave's earnings.\n\n$39.33 + $14.57 = ?\n\nAdding them up:\n\n39.33\n\n+14.57\n\n---------\n\n53.90\n\nYes, that matches Dave's earnings. So, the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of pennies to make sure I'm not making any mistakes with the decimals.\n\n$53.90 is 5390 cents, and $39.33 is 3933 cents.\n\nSubtracting: 5390 - 3933 = ?\n\n5390 - 3933:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n0 - 3: can't do that, so borrow 1 from the tens place.

Vondra is putting together bags of groceries to donate to charity. She has 7 boxes of macaroni and cheese and 14 cans of vegetables. She wants to divide them up evenly, so each bag has the same contents and no items are left over. I need to find out the greatest number of bags of groceries Vondra can put together.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. So, she has 7 boxes of macaroni and cheese and 14 cans of vegetables. I need to divide these into bags with the same contents, without any leftovers.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to distribute these items evenly among the bags. Let's consider the number of bags she can make.\n\nIf she makes 1 bag, then it's easy: all 7 boxes of macaroni and all 14 cans of vegetables go into that one bag. But she probably wants to make more than one bag to distribute to more people.\n\nIf she makes 2 bags, then each bag would have 3.5 boxes of macaroni and cheese and 7 cans of vegetables. But you can't have half a box, so that doesn't work.\n\nWait, no, she has 7 boxes of macaroni and cheese. If she makes 2 bags, each bag would have 7 divided by 2, which is 3.5 boxes. But since she can't split a box, that's not possible. So 2 bags won't work.\n\nWhat about 3 bags? 7 divided by 3 is approximately 2.333, which isn't a whole number. So that doesn't work either.\n\nHmm, maybe 4 bags? 7 divided by 4 is 1.75, which again isn't a whole number.\n\n5 bags? 7 divided by 5 is 1.4, not a whole number.\n\n6 bags? 7 divided by 6 is about 1.166, still not a whole number.\n\n7 bags? 7 divided by 7 is 1 box per bag. And 14 cans of vegetables divided by 7 is 2 cans per bag. That seems to work. Each bag would have 1 box of macaroni and cheese and 2 cans of vegetables. And there would be no items left over.\n\nIs there a way to make more than 7 bags? Let's see. If she makes 8 bags, 7 divided by 8 is 0.875, which isn't a whole number. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait a minute, maybe there's a better way to approach this. Maybe I should think about the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, 7 and 14. The GCD is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet's find the GCD of 7 and 14.\n\n7 is a prime number, so its factors are 1 and 7.\n\n14 is 2 times 7, so its factors are 1, 2, 7, and 14.\n\nThe common factors are 1 and 7. The greatest common divisor is 7.\n\nSo, the GCD is 7, which means the greatest number of bags she can make is 7, with each bag having 1 box of macaroni and cheese and 2 cans of vegetables.\n\nLet me double-check this. If she makes 7 bags, each with 1 box of macaroni and cheese and 2 cans of vegetables, that would use up all 7 boxes and 14 cans (since 7 bags times 2 cans per bag equals 14 cans). No items are left over, and each bag has the same contents. That seems perfect.\n\nIs there any way she could make more than 7 bags? Well, if she tries to make 14 bags, for example, she would need to put half a box of macaroni and cheese in each bag, which isn't practical since she can't split the boxes. So, 7 bags is indeed the maximum number she can make without splitting the boxes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she could make fewer bags, like 1 bag with all items, or 7 bags as I suggested. But the problem asks for the greatest number of bags, so 7 bags is the answer.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this. Maybe she could have different combinations in the bags, but the problem specifies that each bag should have the same contents. So, all bags must have the same number of boxes of macaroni and cheese and the same number of cans of vegetables.\n\nTherefore, the number of bags must be a common divisor of both 7 and 14.

How many cakes can you make with 37 eggs?\" Okay, let's see. I need to find out how many cakes I can make if each cake requires 3 eggs and I have 37 eggs in total.\n\nFirst, I should probably divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed for one cake. So, that's 37 eggs divided by 3 eggs per cake. Let's do that division: 37 \u00f7 3.\n\nHmm, 3 goes into 37 how many times? Well, 3 times 12 is 36, which is just below 37. And 3 times 13 is 39, which is more than 37. So, 3 goes into 37 twelve times with a remainder.\n\nLet me calculate that: 3 times 12 is 36, and 37 minus 36 is 1. So, there's a remainder of 1 egg.\n\nBut, since I can't make a cake with just 1 egg\u2014because each cake requires 3 eggs\u2014that extra egg doesn't help me make another cake. So, with 37 eggs, I can make 12 cakes and have 1 egg left over.\n\nWait a minute, but I need to make sure that I'm not missing something here. Maybe I should think about it differently. Perhaps I can use multiplication to check my answer.\n\nIf I multiply the number of cakes by the number of eggs per cake, I should get the total number of eggs used. So, 12 cakes times 3 eggs per cake equals 36 eggs. And since I have 37 eggs, that leaves me with 1 egg unused.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about how many groups of 3 eggs I can make from 37 eggs. Again, that's the same as division: 37 divided by 3, which is 12 with a remainder of 1.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider that each cake requires 3 eggs, so for n cakes, I need 3n eggs. I have 37 eggs, so I need to find the largest integer n such that 3n \u2264 37.\n\nSolving for n: n \u2264 37 \u00f7 3, which is n \u2264 12.333... But since n has to be a whole number\u2014because I can't make a fraction of a cake\u2014I need to round down to the nearest whole number, which is 12.\n\nSo, again, I get that I can make 12 cakes with 37 eggs.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to approach this problem. Maybe using subtraction? I could subtract 3 eggs for each cake I make until I don't have enough eggs left to make another cake.\n\nStarting with 37 eggs:\n\n- After making 1 cake: 37 - 3 = 34 eggs left\n\n- After making 2 cakes: 34 - 3 = 31 eggs left\n\n- After making 3 cakes: 31 - 3 = 28 eggs left\n\n- After making 4 cakes: 28 - 3 = 25 eggs left\n\n- After making 5 cakes: 25 - 3 = 22 eggs left\n\n- After making 6 cakes: 22 - 3 = 19 eggs left\n\n- After making 7 cakes: 19 - 3 = 16 eggs left\n\n- After making 8 cakes: 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left\n\n- After making 9 cakes: 13 - 3 = 10 eggs left\n\n- After making 10 cakes: 10 - 3 = 7 eggs left\n\n- After making 11 cakes: 7 - 3 = 4 eggs left\n\n- After making 12 cakes: 4 - 3 = 1 egg left\n\nAt this point, I have 1 egg left, which isn't enough to make another cake. So, again, I can make 12 cakes.\n\nThis method is more time-consuming, but it confirms the answer I got from division.\n\nI should also consider if there's any other factor that might affect the number of cakes I can make. For example, are there any restrictions on the use of other ingredients? But the problem only mentions eggs, so I assume that eggs are the limiting factor here.\n\nAdditionally, the problem doesn't mention any constraints like having to use all the eggs or anything like that. It's a straightforward question: how many cakes can be made with 37 eggs if each cake requires 3 eggs.\n\nSo, based on that, I'm confident that the answer is 12 cakes.\n\nWait, but just to", "answer": "12", "equiv": false}, {"output": "48", "answer": "48", "equiv": true}, {"output": "66", "answer": "66", "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": "4", "equiv": true}, {"output": "9", "answer": "9", "equiv": true}, {"output": "11", "answer": "11", "equiv": true}, {"output": "51", "answer": "51", "equiv": true}, {"output": "36", "answer": "36", "equiv": true}, {"output": "350", "answer": "350", "equiv": true}, {"output": "738", "answer": "738", "equiv": true}, {"output": "22", "answer": "22", "equiv": true}, {"output": "1540", "answer": "1540", "equiv": true}, {"output": "17408", "answer": "17408", "equiv": true}, {"output": "59", "answer": "59", "equiv": true}, {"output": "13", "answer": "13", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here about pizzas sold at John's Pizza Palace. They were open for 6 hours, and during that time, they sold different numbers of various types of pizzas: 92 pepperoni, 106 sausage, 96 cheese, 104 mushroom, 96 anchovies, and 88 pineapple. The question is asking for the mean number of pizzas sold. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what \"mean\" means in this context. Mean is just another word for average. So, I need to find the average number of pizzas sold per type. Makes sense because there are different types of pizzas, and we want to know, on average, how many of each type were sold.\n\nNow, to find the average, I know that I need to add up all the values and then divide by the number of values. In this case, the values are the numbers of each type of pizza sold, and the number of values is the number of different pizza types.\n\nSo, let's list out the numbers again:\n\n- Pepperoni: 92\n\n- Sausage: 106\n\n- Cheese: 96\n\n- Mushroom: 104\n\n- Anchovies: 96\n\n- Pineapple: 88\n\nFirst, I need to find the total number of pizzas sold. I'll do that by adding all these numbers together.\n\nLet's add them step by step to avoid mistakes:\n\n92 + 106 = 198\n\n198 + 96 = 294\n\n294 + 104 = 400\n\n400 + 96 = 496\n\n496 + 88 = 584\n\nSo, the total number of pizzas sold is 584.\n\nNext, I need to divide this total by the number of pizza types to find the mean. How many types are there? Let's count them:\n\n1. Pepperoni\n\n2. Sausage\n\n3. Cheese\n\n4. Mushroom\n\n5. Anchovies\n\n6. Pineapple\n\nSo, there are 6 different types of pizzas.\n\nNow, I'll divide the total number of pizzas by the number of types:\n\n584 \u00f7 6\n\nLet me do this division carefully. 6 goes into 58 four times (6*4=24), subtract 24 from 58, which leaves 34. Then, 6 goes into 34 five times (6*5=30), subtract 30 from 34, which leaves 4. So, it's 97 with a remainder of 4.\n\nBut, since we're dealing with an average, it's okay to have a decimal. So, I can continue the division by adding a decimal point and a zero to the remainder.\n\n40 divided by 6 is 6, because 6*6=36. Subtract 36 from 40, which leaves 4 again. So, it's 97.333..., repeating.\n\nAlternatively, I can express it as 97 and 1/3, but since the problem doesn't specify the format, I'll stick with the decimal.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check my addition again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding up the total number of pizzas.\n\nLet's add them once more:\n\n92 + 106 = 198\n\n198 + 96 = 294\n\n294 + 104 = 400\n\n400 + 96 = 496\n\n496 + 88 = 584\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, dividing 584 by 6:\n\n584 \u00f7 6 = 97.333...\n\nSo, the mean number of pizzas sold per type is approximately 97.33.\n\nBut, I should consider if the problem expects me to round it to a certain decimal place. The problem says to simplify the answer as much as possible, but it doesn't specify the precision.\n\nMaybe I should look back at the numbers. All the numbers of pizzas sold are whole numbers, so it's possible that the mean should also be expressed as a whole number. However, since 584 divided by 6 is not a whole number, it's expected to have a decimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the mean per hour, but looking back, it asks for the mean of the number of pizzas sold, which, in this context, refers to the mean per type.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says, \"the mean of the number of pizzas sold.\" It doesn't specify per hour or per type.

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that's a multiple of both, which would be the first time both clocks ring together again.\n\nSo, the first clock rings every 90 minutes, and the second every 60 minutes. I need to find the LCM of 90 and 60.\n\nFirst, I should probably factor these numbers into their prime factors to find the LCM.\n\nLet's start with 90.\n\n90 can be factored into 2 \u00d7 45.\n\n45 is 3 \u00d7 15.\n\n15 is 3 \u00d7 5.\n\nSo, 90 is 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5, or 2 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5.\n\nNow, 60.\n\n60 is 2 \u00d7 30.\n\n30 is 2 \u00d7 15.\n\n15 is 3 \u00d7 5.\n\nSo, 60 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5, or 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5.\n\nTo find the LCM, I need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n\nSo, for 2, the highest power is 2\u00b2 (from 60).\n\nFor 3, the highest power is 3\u00b2 (from 90).\n\nFor 5, the highest power is 5 (both have 5 to the first power).\n\nSo, LCM should be 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n2\u00b2 is 4.\n\n3\u00b2 is 9.\n\n4 \u00d7 9 is 36.\n\n36 \u00d7 5 is 180.\n\nSo, the LCM of 90 and 60 is 180.\n\nDoes that make sense? Let's check.\n\nEvery 180 minutes, both clocks should ring together.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFirst clock rings at 0, 90, 180, 270, etc. minutes.\n\nSecond clock rings at 0, 60, 120, 180, 240, etc. minutes.\n\nYes, at 180 minutes, both ring together.\n\nIs there a smaller number where they ring together? Let's see.\n\nIs there a number less than 180 that is a multiple of both 90 and 60?\n\nLet's see, 90 and 60.\n\nWell, 90 and 60 share a common factor of 30.\n\nBut 30 isn't a multiple of both; 30 is a factor.\n\nWait, the LCM is supposed to be the smallest multiple that both numbers share.\n\nSo, 180 is the smallest number that both 90 and 60 divide into without a remainder.\n\nLet me confirm by dividing 180 by 90 and by 60.\n\n180 \u00f7 90 = 2, which is an integer.\n\n180 \u00f7 60 = 3, which is also an integer.\n\nSo, yes, 180 is indeed the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the clocks will ring together again after 180 minutes.\n\nWait a minute, is there a way to confirm this another way?\n\nMaybe using the greatest common divisor, or GCD.\n\nI recall that LCM times GCD of two numbers equals the product of the numbers.\n\nSo, LCM(a, b) \u00d7 GCD(a, b) = a \u00d7 b.\n\nSo, if a is 90 and b is 60, then LCM(90, 60) \u00d7 GCD(90, 60) should equal 90 \u00d7 60 = 5400.\n\nWe already have LCM(90, 60) = 180.\n\nSo, GCD(90, 60) should be 5400 \u00f7 180 = 30.\n\nIs the GCD of 90 and 60 indeed 30?\n\nWell, 90 divided by 30 is 3, and 60 divided by 30 is 2, both integers, and 30 is the largest number that divides both 90 and 60 without a remainder.\n\nYes, GCD is 30.\n\nSo, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively,", "answer": "180", "equiv": false}, {"output": "40", "answer": "40", "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": "7", "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": "8", "equiv": true}, {"output": "70", "answer": "70", "equiv": true}, {"output": "100", "answer": "100", "equiv": true}, {"output": "22", "answer": "22", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this math problem here, and I need to solve it step by step. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nAn eight-foot board is cut into two pieces. One piece is 2 feet longer than the other. How long are the pieces?\n\nAlright, so we have a board that's 8 feet long, and it's being cut into two pieces. One of these pieces is 2 feet longer than the other. I need to find out the lengths of both pieces.\n\nFirst, I should probably define variables for the lengths of the two pieces. Let's say the length of the shorter piece is x feet. Then, since the longer piece is 2 feet longer than the shorter one, its length would be x + 2 feet.\n\nNow, since the total length of the board is 8 feet, the sum of the lengths of the two pieces should equal 8 feet. So, I can set up an equation:\n\nx + (x + 2) = 8\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n2x + 2 = 8\n\nNext, I'll subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the terms with x:\n\n2x = 6\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\n\nx = 3\n\nSo, the shorter piece is 3 feet long. Then, the longer piece is x + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 feet long.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If the shorter piece is 3 feet and the longer piece is 5 feet, adding them together gives 3 + 5 = 8 feet, which matches the total length of the board. Also, the longer piece is indeed 2 feet longer than the shorter one, since 5 - 3 = 2. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this differently. Let's think about it again.\n\nSuppose I let the length of the longer piece be y feet. Then, the shorter piece would be y - 2 feet, since it's 2 feet shorter.\n\nAgain, the sum of their lengths should be 8 feet:\n\ny + (y - 2) = 8\n\nSimplifying:\n\n2y - 2 = 8\n\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n\n2y = 10\n\nDivide by 2:\n\ny = 5\n\nSo, the longer piece is 5 feet, and the shorter piece is y - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3 feet. Same answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of averaging. If one piece is 2 feet longer than the other, the difference between them is 2 feet. The total length is 8 feet.\n\nLet me think about the average length of the two pieces. The average would be 8 feet divided by 2, which is 4 feet. So, if one piece is 4 feet, and the other is 2 feet longer, that would be 6 feet. Wait, but that doesn't add up to 8 feet because 4 + 6 = 10, which is too much.\n\nHmm, I must have messed up somewhere. Let me try that approach again.\n\nIf the average length is 4 feet, and one piece is d feet shorter than the average, and the other is d feet longer, then:\n\nShorter piece: 4 - d\n\nLonger piece: 4 + d\n\nTotal length: (4 - d) + (4 + d) = 8 feet\n\nAnd the difference between the two pieces is (4 + d) - (4 - d) = 2d feet\n\nWe know the difference is 2 feet, so:\n\n2d = 2\n\nTherefore, d = 1\n\nSo, shorter piece: 4 - 1 = 3 feet\n\nLonger piece: 4 + 1 = 5 feet\n\nAgain, same answer as before. So, it seems consistent.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that if both pieces were of equal length, they would each be 4 feet long. But one piece is 2 feet longer than the other, so I need to distribute that 2-foot difference.\n\nIf I take 1 foot away from one piece and add it to the other, that would make one piece 3 feet and the other 5 feet, which maintains the total of 8 feet and a difference of 2 feet. That makes sense.\n\nI think I've confirmed the answer using multiple methods. The shorter piece is 3 feet long, and the longer piece is 5 feet long.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other possible way to interpret the problem. The problem states that one piece is 2 feet longer than the other. It doesn't specify which piece is longer, but logically, one is longer than the other by 2 feet.\n\nGiven that, and the total length being 8 feet", "answer": "3", "equiv": false}, {"output": "93", "answer": "93", "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": "10", "equiv": true}, {"output": "127", "answer": "127", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this problem here: On Annie's birthday, almost everyone in her class came to surprise her. She has 15 girl classmates, 20 boy classmates, and 3 teachers in her class. The question is, how many people attended her birthday party?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"almost everyone\" means. It probably means that nearly all the people in her class came, but maybe not everyone. But the problem doesn't specify who exactly didn't come, so I think I should assume that all the classmates and teachers came, since it says \"almost everyone.\"\n\nWait, but \"almost everyone\" suggests that perhaps one or two might have been absent. However, since the problem doesn't give specific numbers about who didn't come, it's probably safe to assume that all of them attended.\n\nSo, I should add up the number of girl classmates, boy classmates, and teachers to find the total number of people who attended.\n\nLet's list them out:\n\n- Girl classmates: 15\n\n- Boy classmates: 20\n\n- Teachers: 3\n\nNow, I just need to add these numbers together.\n\n15 (girls) + 20 (boys) + 3 (teachers) = ?\n\nFirst, add the girls and boys: 15 + 20 = 35\n\nThen, add the teachers: 35 + 3 = 38\n\nSo, 38 people attended her birthday party.\n\nBut wait a minute, does \"classmates\" include Annie herself? Or is she separate from the 15 girl classmates and 20 boy classmates?\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Annie has 15 girl classmates, 20 boy classmates, and 3 teachers in her class.\"\n\nThe way it's phrased, \"girl classmates\" and \"boy classmates\" suggests that these are her peers, excluding herself. So, the 15 girls and 20 boys are her classmates, not including Annie.\n\nTherefore, the total number of people who attended would be the sum of the girl classmates, boy classmates, and teachers, which is 15 + 20 + 3 = 38.\n\nBut, perhaps Annie was also present at her own birthday party. If that's the case, then I should include her in the total count.\n\nHowever, since the problem says \"almost everyone in her class came to surprise her,\" it seems like they came to surprise her, implying that she was already there. So, the attendees are her classmates and teachers coming to see her.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Annie was elsewhere, and they came to her location to surprise her, in which case she would be included in the count.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. To simplify, perhaps I should consider that the attendees are only the people who came to surprise her, not including herself.\n\nGiven that, the total would be 15 girls + 20 boys + 3 teachers = 35 people.\n\nBut earlier, I added up to 38.

If she was present at the party, then the total would be 35 (classmates and teachers) plus 1 (Annie) = 36.\n\nBut, I'm not sure if Annie should be included in the count of attendees since the problem says \"almost everyone in her class came to surprise her.\"\n\nThis suggests that the surprise is for Annie, implying that she was present and the others came to surprise her.\n\nIn that case, the attendees would be her 15 girl classmates, 20 boy classmates, and 3 teachers, totaling 35 people.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Annie was not initially at the party location and they surprised her by showing up, in which case she might be considered an attendee as well.\n\nThis is getting a bit too speculative.

I need to figure out how many beads she'll put in the fifth jar if the pattern continues.\n\nFirst, I should try to identify the pattern. Let's look at the numbers:\n\n- Jar 1: 74\n\n- Jar 2: 83\n\n- Jar 3: 92\n\n- Jar 4: 101\n\nI can see that each time, the number of beads increases. So, it's probably an arithmetic sequence, where there's a common difference between terms.\n\nLet me calculate the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- 83 - 74 = 9\n\n- 92 - 83 = 9\n\n- 101 - 92 = 9\n\nOkay, so each time, the number of beads increases by 9.

It seems straightforward, but maybe I should check if there's another pattern or if this is too simple.\n\nLet me see: Is there any other way to look at this?\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the position of the jar and see if there's a formula that relates the jar number to the number of beads.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find a general formula for the nth jar.\n\nIf it's an arithmetic sequence, the general formula is:\n\na_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d\n\nWhere:\n\n- a_n is the number of beads in the nth jar\n\n- a_1 is the number of beads in the first jar (74)\n\n- n is the jar number\n\n- d is the common difference (9)\n\nSo, for the fifth jar (n = 5):\n\na_5 = 74 + (5 - 1) * 9\n\na_5 = 74 + 4 * 9\n\na_5 = 74 + 36\n\na_5 = 110\n\nOkay, that matches what I got earlier by just adding 9 to the fourth jar.\n\nMaybe to be extra sure, I can check if this formula works for the other jars.\n\nFor Jar 2 (n = 2):\n\na_2 = 74 + (2 - 1) * 9 = 74 + 9 = 83\n\nThat matches the given number.\n\nFor Jar 3 (n = 3):\n\na_3 = 74 + (3 - 1) * 9 = 74 + 18 = 92\n\nAlso matches.\n\nFor Jar 4 (n = 4):\n\na_4 = 74 + (4 - 1) * 9 = 74 + 27 = 101\n\nPerfect, it matches.\n\nSo, the formula is consistent with the given data.\n\nTherefore, for Jar 5 (n = 5):\n\na_5 = 74 + (5 - 1) * 9 = 74 + 36 = 110\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there could be another pattern at play here.\n\nIs it possible that the difference isn't constant, but maybe it's increasing or something else?\n\nLet me check the differences again:\n\n- 83 - 74 = 9\n\n- 92 - 83 = 9\n\n- 101 - 92 = 9\n\nYes, the difference is consistently 9.

Vera wants an equal number of cards and envelopes. Cards come in packs of 20, and envelopes come in packs of 17. So, she has to buy whole packs of each, and I need to find the smallest number of cards she can end up with while having the same number of cards and envelopes.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. If she buys one pack of cards, she gets 20 cards, and if she buys one pack of envelopes, she gets 17 envelopes. But since she wants the same number of each, buying one pack of each won't work because 20 isn't equal to 17.\n\nSo, she needs to buy multiple packs of each to reach a number where the total number of cards equals the total number of envelopes.

The question is asking how many such piles he can make, and it says to approximate the answer.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. It's a division problem, right? Because he's dividing 201 pieces into groups of 43 each. So, I need to divide 201 by 43 to find out how many full piles he can make.\n\nLet me write that down: 201 \u00f7 43.\n\nNow, I'm a bit rusty on my division, especially with larger numbers, but I'll try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should see how many times 43 can go into 201.\n\nI know that 43 times 4 is 172, because 40 times 4 is 160, and 3 times 4 is 12, so 160 plus 12 is 172.\n\nNow, if I subtract 172 from 201, that gives me 201 minus 172, which is 29.\n\nSo, 43 goes into 201 four times with a remainder of 29.\n\nBut the problem says to approximate, so maybe I don't need to worry about the remainder too much.\n\nWait, but approximation usually means making an estimate that's close enough, even if it's not exact. So, in this case, since 43 times 4 is 172, which is less than 201, and 43 times 5 would be 215, which is more than 201, the exact number of piles would be 4 with some candy left over.\n\nBut perhaps I can express this as a decimal to approximate it better.\n\nLet me see: 43 times 4 is 172, and 201 minus 172 is 29. So, the remainder is 29.\n\nIf I think about it in terms of decimals, 29 out of 43 is like 29/43.\n\nI can divide 29 by 43 to get a decimal. Let's see:\n\n29 divided by 43 is... hmm, 43 goes into 29 zero times, so I need to add a decimal point and a zero, making it 290.\n\n43 goes into 290 how many times? 43 times 6 is 258, which is less than 290.\n\nSubtract 258 from 290, and I get 32.\n\nSo, 43 goes into 320... 43 times 7 is 301, which is less than 320.\n\nSubtract 301 from 320, and I get 19.\n\nSo, it's looking like 0.674, but I can stop here because the problem says to approximate.\n\nSo, approximately, 29 divided by 43 is about 0.67.\n\nTherefore, the total number of piles is 4 plus 0.67, which is about 4.67.\n\nBut since we're dealing with piles of candy, and you can't really have a fraction of a pile, maybe it's better to think in terms of full piles.\n\nSo, Adam can make 4 full piles of 43 each, with some candy left over.\n\nBut the problem says to approximate, so perhaps 5 piles, acknowledging that the fifth pile wouldn't be full.\n\nWait, but 4.67 is closer to 5, so maybe rounding up makes sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, since he can't make a full fifth pile, it might be more accurate to say 4 piles.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused now.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can use multiplication to estimate.\n\nI know that 43 times 4 is 172, which is less than 201.\n\n43 times 5 is 215, which is more than 201.\n\nSo, 4 full piles with a remainder.\n\nBut again, approximation-wise, maybe it's better to say 5 piles, understanding that the fifth one isn't complete.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects a whole number answer.\n\nIn that case, 4 piles would be the answer, since that's how many full piles he can make.\n\nBut the problem says to approximate, which suggests that a decimal or a fraction might be acceptable.\n\nLet me check the context again.

Wait a minute, maybe I don't need to know the total number he started with because it's about how many he has left after eating 64.\n\nActually, now that I think about it, I think I do need to know how many packages he had initially. Because without knowing that, I can't determine the total number of Sweettarts he started with. So, perhaps there's some information missing here.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Sweettarts come in packages of 7. Stephen ate 64 Sweettarts. How many Sweettarts does he have left?\" Hmm, it doesn't specify how many packages he had to begin with.\n\nMaybe the question assumes that he had only one package. But that seems unlikely because one package has 7 Sweettarts, and he ate 64, which is way more than one package. So, if he only had one package, he couldn't have eaten 64 Sweettarts. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is implying that he had multiple packages, and I need to find out how many are left after he ate 64.\n\nBut without knowing the total number of packages he had, I'm stuck. Or is there another way to approach this?\n\nWait a second, maybe the question is about remaining Sweettarts in terms of complete packages and extras. Like, after eating 64, how many full packages and extra Sweettarts are left.\n\nBut that still doesn't seem right because the question asks for \"how many Sweettarts he has left,\" not how many packages.\n\nLet me consider that each package has 7 Sweettarts, and he ate 64. Maybe I need to find out the remainder when 64 is divided by 7, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 7 times 9 is 63, and 7 times 10 is 70. So, 63 is less than 64, and 70 is more than 64. 64 minus 63 is 1, so the remainder is 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Maybe I'm overcomplicating things.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to assume that Stephen had a certain number of packages, enough to cover the 64 he ate plus the leftovers.\n\nWait, maybe it's about division and remainders. If he ate 64 Sweettarts and they come in packages of 7, maybe I need to see how many packages he ate and how many are left.\n\nBut again, without knowing the total number of packages he started with, I can't determine how many are left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is just trying to test simple subtraction: if he had some Sweettarts and ate 64, how many are left. But that doesn't make sense because I don't know the initial amount.\n\nI think there might be some missing information here. Perhaps the problem is assuming that he had exactly the number of Sweettarts in a certain number of packages, and after eating 64, some are left.\n\nWait, maybe it's about finding the smallest number of packages he could have had to eat 64 Sweettarts and have some left over.\n\nBut that seems too complicated for the question asked.\n\nLet me try a different approach. If Sweettarts come in packages of 7, and he ate 64, maybe I need to find out how many packages that corresponds to.\n\nSo, 64 divided by 7 is 9 packages with 1 Sweettart left over, since 7 times 9 is 63, and 64 minus 63 is 1.\n\nBut again, without knowing the total number of packages he had initially, I can't determine how many are left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is saying that he had a certain number of packages, ate 64 Sweettarts, and now has some left, and I need to find out how many are left.\n\nBut it's not specifying the initial number of packages or Sweettarts.\n\nWait, maybe it's assumed that he had exactly the number of Sweettarts in a certain number of packages, and after eating 64, some are left.\n\nBut that still doesn't give me enough information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is poorly worded, and what it really means is that Sweettarts come in packages of 7, Stephen ate 64 Sweettarts, and now has some left from the last package", "answer": "1", "equiv": false}, {"output": "4", "answer": "4", "equiv": true}, {"output": "18", "answer": "18", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this math problem here: \"There are 15 shapes. How many groups of 3 can you make with them?\" Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how many groups of 3 shapes I can make from a total of 15 shapes.\n\nFirst, I should think about what this is asking. It's not asking for the number of ways to arrange the shapes or anything like that; it's just asking how many groups of 3 I can make. So, I think this is a combination problem, where order doesn't matter.\n\nIn combinations, we use the formula:\n\n\\[\nC(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n- \\( n \\) is the total number of items,\n\n- \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose,\n\n- \\( n! \\) is the factorial of n, which means the product of all positive integers up to n.\n\nSo, in this case, \\( n = 15 \\) and \\( k = 3 \\). Plugging these into the formula, I get:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 3) = \\frac{15!}{3!(15 - 3)!} = \\frac{15!}{3! \\cdot 12!}\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to simplify this. I know that \\( 15! \\) is \\( 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12! \\), so the \\( 12! \\) in the numerator and denominator will cancel out.\n\n\\[\nC(15, 3) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12!}{3! \\times 12!} = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{3!}\n\\]\n\nNext, I need to calculate \\( 3! \\), which is \\( 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\).\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 3) = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerator:\n\n\\( 15 \\times 14 = 210 \\)\n\n\\( 210 \\times 13 = 2730 \\)\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[\nC(15, 3) = \\frac{2730}{6}\n\\]\n\nNow, divide 2730 by 6:\n\n\\( 2730 \u00f7 6 = 455 \\)\n\nTherefore, the number of groups of 3 that can be made from 15 shapes is 455.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's a simpler way to think about this. If I have 15 shapes and I want to make groups of 3, couldn't I just divide 15 by 3?\n\n\\( 15 \u00f7 3 = 5 \\)\n\nBut that can't be right because earlier calculation gave me 455, which is much larger. So, what's the difference here?\n\nOh, I see. Dividing 15 by 3 gives the number of groups if the shapes are divided equally into groups of 3, but that's not what the question is asking. The question is asking for how many different groups of 3 can be made from 15 shapes, which is a combination problem.\n\nSo, my first approach is correct. The answer should be 455.\n\nLet me try another way to confirm. Let's think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, I choose one shape out of 15. Then, I choose another shape out of the remaining 14, and then another out of the remaining 13.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 3 shapes in order would be:\n\n\\( 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 = 2730 \\)\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter in groups, I've overcounted. Each group of 3 has been counted multiple times, depending on the order.\n\nSpecifically, each group of 3 can be arranged in \\( 3! = 6 \\) ways.\n\nTherefore, to get the number of unique groups, I need to divide the total ordered selections by the number of arrangements per group:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of groups} = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{3!} = \\frac{2730}{6} = 455\n\\]\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the combination formula directly.

So, we have information about students voting for their favorite snack at Memorial School. The options are candy and popcorn. The problem tells us that for every 5 students who voted for candy, 2 students voted for popcorn. And we're given that there were 45 votes for candy. We need to find out how many fewer students voted for popcorn than candy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the votes for candy and popcorn. The ratio given is 5 to 2, meaning for every 5 votes for candy, there are 2 votes for popcorn. This is a proportional relationship, so I can set up a proportion to find out the number of votes for popcorn.\n\nLet's denote the number of votes for popcorn as P. According to the ratio, the relationship can be expressed as:\n\n5 / 2 = 45 / P\n\nThis reads: 5 votes for candy are to 2 votes for popcorn as 45 votes for candy are to P votes for popcorn.\n\nNow, I need to solve for P. To do this, I can cross-multiply:\n\n5 * P = 2 * 45\n\n5P = 90\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5 to solve for P:\n\nP = 90 / 5\n\nP = 18\n\nSo, there were 18 votes for popcorn.\n\nThe problem asks how many fewer students voted for popcorn than candy. To find this, I subtract the number of votes for popcorn from the number of votes for candy:\n\n45 - 18 = 27\n\nTherefore, 27 fewer students voted for popcorn than candy.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. I set up the proportion as 5/2 = 45/P, and that led me to P = 18. That seems correct, but maybe I should verify another way.\n\nAnother approach could be to think in terms of total parts. The ratio is 5:2 for candy to popcorn, which means for every 7 parts (5 + 2), 5 parts are candy and 2 parts are popcorn.\n\nGiven that 45 votes for candy correspond to the 5 parts, I can find the value of one part and then find the number of parts for popcorn.\n\nSo, if 5 parts = 45 votes, then one part = 45 / 5 = 9 votes.\n\nTherefore, popcorn, which is 2 parts, would have 2 * 9 = 18 votes.\n\nAgain, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nNow, to find how many fewer students voted for popcorn than candy, I subtract the popcorn votes from the candy votes: 45 - 18 = 27.\n\nSo, the answer should be 27.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. The ratio is 5:2 for candy to popcorn, and there are 45 votes for candy. Is there any possibility that the total number of votes is relevant here, or that there are other snack options? The problem doesn't mention any other options, so I assume that only candy and popcorn are being considered.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"for every 5 students that voted for candy, 2 students voted for popcorn.\" This clearly establishes the ratio, and since we're given the number of votes for candy, we can confidently find the number of votes for popcorn using the ratio.\n\nSo, sticking with my initial approach, I believe the answer is 27.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider setting up the problem with equations.\n\nLet C be the number of votes for candy, and P be the number of votes for popcorn.\n\nWe know that C = 45.\n\nThe ratio is C/P = 5/2.\n\nSo, 45 / P = 5/2.\n\nCross-multiplying: 5P = 90 => P = 18.\n\nThen, the difference is 45 - 18 = 27.\n\nSame result.\n\nI think that's solid.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the ratio as fractions.\n\nIf candy votes are 5 parts and popcorn votes are 2 parts, then the fraction of votes for candy is 5/7 and for popcorn is 2/7.\n\nBut since we only know the candy votes, we can find the total votes first.\n\nIf 5/7 of total votes = 45, then total votes T = 45 / (5/7) = 45 * (7/5) = 63.\n\nThen, popcorn votes P = 2/7 of total votes = 2/7 * 63 = 18.\n\nAgain, the difference is 45 - 18 = 27.\n\nConsistent results across multiple methods confirm that 27 is the correct answer.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning", "answer": "27", "equiv": false}, {"output": "6:1", "answer": "6:1", "equiv": true}, {"output": "12", "answer": "12", "equiv": true}, {"output": "\\text{Jamal furnished } \\$2500 \\text{ and Moshe furnished } \\$5000.", "answer": "2500", "equiv": false}, {"output": "547", "answer": "547", "equiv": true}, {"output": "82", "answer": "82", "equiv": true}, {"output": "92", "answer": "92", "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": "7", "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the problem is about Luther's Paint Supplies selling equal quantities of two paint colors, yellow and blue. The yellow paint comes in 2-liter containers, and the blue paint comes in 19-liter containers. We need to find the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means for the store to sell equal quantities of yellow and blue paint. That means the total volume of yellow paint sold is equal to the total volume of blue paint sold.\n\nNow, yellow paint is sold in 2-liter containers, so the total volume of yellow paint sold would be 2 liters times the number of containers sold. Similarly, blue paint is sold in 19-liter containers, so the total volume of blue paint sold would be 19 liters times the number of containers sold.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of yellow containers sold as y and the number of blue containers sold as b. Then, the total volume of yellow paint sold is 2y liters, and the total volume of blue paint sold is 19b liters.\n\nSince the quantities sold are equal, we can set up the equation:\n\n2y = 19b\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest positive integer values for y and b that satisfy this equation.\n\nThis looks like a problem involving least common multiples or perhaps finding the smallest integer solution to an equation.\n\nLet me think about it. We need to find the smallest values of y and b such that 2y is equal to 19b.\n\nSince 2 and 19 are both prime numbers, their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1, which means they don't share any common factors other than 1.\n\nIn such cases, the smallest solution occurs when y is a multiple of 19 and b is a multiple of 2, specifically the smallest multiples that make both sides equal.\n\nLet\u2019s try to solve for y in terms of b:\n\n2y = 19b\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\ny = (19b)/2\n\nFor y to be an integer, (19b) must be divisible by 2. Since 19 is odd, b must be even for the product to be divisible by 2.\n\nSimilarly, if we solve for b in terms of y:\n\n19b = 2y\n\nb = (2y)/19\n\nFor b to be an integer, 2y must be divisible by 19. Since 2 and 19 are coprime, y must be a multiple of 19.\n\nSo, y must be a multiple of 19, and b must be a multiple of 2.\n\nLet\u2019s set y = 19k and b = 2k, where k is a positive integer.\n\nPlugging back into the equation:\n\n2*(19k) = 19*(2k)\n\n38k = 38k\n\nThis holds true for any positive integer k.\n\nThe smallest positive integer value for k is 1.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of yellow containers sold is y = 19*1 = 19, and the smallest number of blue containers sold is b = 2*1 = 2.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the smallest amount of each paint color sold, which would be the total volume, not just the number of containers.\n\nSo, the smallest amount of yellow paint sold is 2 liters/container * 19 containers = 38 liters.\n\nSimilarly, the smallest amount of blue paint sold is 19 liters/container * 2 containers = 38 liters.\n\nSo, the smallest amount of each paint color the store must have sold is 38 liters.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check this.\n\nIs there a smaller total volume that satisfies the condition?\n\nSuppose we consider smaller numbers of containers.\n\nFor example, if b = 1, then from the equation y = (19*1)/2 = 9.5, which is not an integer. So, y must be at least 19 to make y an integer.\n\nSimilarly, if y = 1, then b = (2*1)/19 \u2248 0.105, which is not an integer.\n\nIf y = 2, then b = (2*2)/19 = 4/19 \u2248 0.21, not an integer.\n\nContinuing this pattern, y needs to be a multiple of 19 to make b an integer.\n\nTherefore, the smallest solution is y = 19, b = 2, resulting in 38 liters of each paint.\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of least common multiples (LCM).\n\nThe LCM of the container sizes, 2 liters and 19 liters, would give us the smallest volume that can be equally divided into both container sizes.\n\nThe LCM of 2", "answer": "38", "equiv": false}, {"output": "40", "answer": "40", "equiv": true}, {"output": "50", "answer": "50", "equiv": true}, {"output": "90", "answer": "90", "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": "7", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem about Farmer Singleton's tomato plants.

Let's look at how the number of plants is changing from one row to the next.\n\nFrom the first row to the second row:\n\n4 to 8. That's an increase of 4, but maybe it's better to think in terms of multiplication. 4 multiplied by 2 is 8.\n\nFrom the second row to the third row:\n\n8 to 16. Again, that's an increase of 8, but again, 8 multiplied by 2 is 16.\n\nFrom the third row to the fourth row:\n\n16 to 32. Similarly, 16 multiplied by 2 is 32.\n\nFrom the fourth row to the fifth row:\n\n32 to 64. Once more, 32 multiplied by 2 is 64.\n\nSo, it looks like each row has twice as many plants as the previous row. That's a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.\n\nTherefore, to find the number of plants in the sixth row, I should multiply the number of plants in the fifth row by 2.\n\nFifth row: 64 plants\n\nSixth row: 64 * 2 = 128 plants\n\nWait a minute, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should check if there's another pattern or if I'm missing something.\n\nLet me see: Is there any other way to interpret the pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is adding an increasing number each time.\n\nFirst to second: +4\n\nSecond to third: +8\n\nThird to fourth: +16\n\nFourth to fifth: +32\n\nSo, each time, the amount added is doubling.\n\nIf that's the case, then from the fifth to the sixth row, I should add 64.\n\nWait, but that would make the sixth row have 64 + 32 = 96 plants. But earlier, using multiplication, I got 128.\n\nHmm, which one is correct?\n\nWait, no. If I look back, from first to second, it's +4.\n\nSecond to third: +8.\n\nThird to fourth: +16.\n\nFourth to fifth: +32.\n\nSo, the increment is doubling each time: 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\n\nSo, from fifth to sixth, it should be +64.\n\nTherefore, fifth row: 64 plants.\n\nSixth row: 64 + 64 = 128 plants.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation using multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of geometric sequences, where each term is multiplied by a common ratio, which in this case is 2.\n\nSo, first term (a) is 4, common ratio (r) is 2.\n\nThe nth term of a geometric sequence is given by a * r^(n-1).\n\nSo, for the sixth row (n=6):\n\n4 * 2^(6-1) = 4 * 2^5 = 4 * 32 = 128.\n\nAgain, that gives me 128 plants.\n\nAlternatively, I can list out the number of plants in each row using the formula:\n\n1st row: 4 * 2^0 = 4\n\n2nd row: 4 * 2^1 = 8\n\n3rd row: 4 * 2^2 = 16\n\n4th row: 4 * 2^3 = 32\n\n5th row: 4 * 2^4 = 64\n\n6th row: 4 * 2^5 = 128\n\nSo, consistently, 128 plants in the sixth row.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this?\n\nMaybe considering the total number of plants up to a certain row.\n\nBut the question is only asking for the number in the sixth row, so maybe that's unnecessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps checking if the pattern could be exponential in a different base, but given that doubling is involved, base 2 seems appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering logarithms, but that's probably overcomplicating things for this problem.\n\nGiven that all methods lead me to 128, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the number of tomato plants in the sixth row is 128.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[", "answer": "128", "equiv": false}, {"output": "So I have this math problem here: \"179 birds were sitting in a tree. 38 more birds flew up to the tree. How many birds were there altogether in the tree?\" Okay, let's see. I need to find out the total number of birds in the tree after more birds joined.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. There are initially 179 birds in the tree. Then, 38 more birds come and sit in the tree. So, to find the total number of birds now in the tree, I should add these two numbers together. That makes sense because when more birds join the ones already there, you just add them up.\n\nSo, the operation I need to perform is addition: 179 plus 38.\n\nLet me write that down: 179 + 38.\n\nNow, how do I add these two numbers? I can add them directly, but maybe breaking them down a bit will help me avoid mistakes.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nI can think of 179 as 100 + 70 + 9.\n\nAnd 38 as 30 + 8.\n\nNow, adding the hundreds, tens, and ones separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds: there's only 100 from 179.\n\nThen, the tens: 70 + 30 = 100.\n\nAnd the ones: 9 + 8 = 17.\n\nNow, adding these up: 100 (from hundreds) + 100 (from tens) + 17 (from ones) = 217.\n\nWait a minute, let me check that again.\n\n100 (hundreds) + 100 (tens) + 17 (ones) = 217. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can add 179 and 38 directly.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n9 + 8 = 17. Write down 7 and carry over 1.\n\nThen, 7 (from 179) + 3 (from 38) + 1 (carried over) = 11. Write down 1 and carry over 1.\n\nFinally, 1 (from 179) + 0 (since 38 has no hundreds) + 1 (carried over) = 2.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 217.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nJust to be sure, maybe I can check this another way.\n\nLet me try subtracting 38 from the total and see if I get back to 179.\n\nSo, if I have 217 - 38, does that equal 179?\n\nLet's see: 217 - 38.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit again:\n\n7 - 8. Well, 7 is less than 8, so I need to borrow from the tens place.\n\nSo, 17 - 8 = 9.\n\nThen, since I borrowed 1, it's 1 (from the tens place) - 3 = -2, which isn't right.\n\nWait, let me do that again.\n\n217 - 38:\n\n7 - 8: can't do that, so borrow 1 from the tens place. So, 17 - 8 = 9.\n\nNow, the tens place: 1 (since I borrowed 1) - 3. But 1 - 3 is negative, which isn't possible without borrowing.\n\nWait, but there's a hundreds place. So, from the hundreds place, 2 - 0 = 2, but I need to borrow from there.\n\nActually, maybe I should do it step by step.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n217\n\n-38\n\n---\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n7 - 8: can't do, so borrow 1 from the tens place. So, 17 - 8 = 9.\n\nNow, the tens place: since I borrowed 1, it's 1 (from the original 1 in 217) - 3. But 1 - 3 is negative, so I need to borrow from the hundreds place.\n\nSo, from the hundreds place: 2 becomes 1, and the tens place becomes 11 (since 10 from borrowing plus the original 1).\n\nNow, 11 - 3 = 8.\n\nAnd the hundreds place: 1 - 0 = 1.\n\nSo, 217 - 38 = 179.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, my addition was correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of birds in the tree is 217.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"simplify your answer as much as possible.\" But ", "answer": "217", "equiv": false}, {"output": "513", "answer": "513", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: There are 119 matchboxes, and they need to be distributed equally among 9 houses in the first block. I need to figure out how many matchboxes each house will get.\n\nFirst, I think I should understand what \"distributed equally\" means. It means that each house gets the same number of matchboxes. So, basically, I need to divide the total number of matchboxes by the number of houses.\n\nSo, the total number of matchboxes is 119, and the number of houses is 9. So, I need to do 119 divided by 9.\n\nLet me recall how division works. When you divide one number by another, you're seeing how many times the second number fits into the first number.\n\nSo, 9 times what equals 119? I know that 9 times 12 is 108, because 9 times 10 is 90, and 9 times 2 is 18, and 90 plus 18 is 108.\n\nNow, 108 is less than 119, so that's good. If I subtract 108 from 119, I get 119 minus 108, which is 11.\n\nSo, 9 goes into 119 twelve times with a remainder of 11. But, in the context of distributing matchboxes, does that make sense? Each house gets 12 matchboxes, and there are 11 left over.\n\nWait a minute, but you can't really distribute partial matchboxes, right? Each house has to get a whole number of matchboxes. So, in this case, each house gets 12 matchboxes, and there are 11 matchboxes that aren't distributed.\n\nBut the question is asking how many matchboxes each house will receive, and it's assuming an equal distribution. So, I think the answer is each house gets 12 matchboxes, and there are 11 leftover.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of division with a decimal. Let me check that.\n\nIf I divide 119 by 9 using long division, 9 goes into 11 once, subtract 9 from 11 to get 2, bring down the 9 to make it 29. 9 goes into 29 three times, 9 times 3 is 27, subtract 27 from 29 to get 2. So, it's 13 with a remainder of 2, but wait, that doesn't seem right because earlier I had 12 with a remainder of 11.\n\nWait, I must have messed up my division. Let me try that again.\n\nLong division: 9 divided into 119.\n\n9 goes into 11 once, 1 times 9 is 9. Subtract 9 from 11 to get 2. Bring down the 9 to make it 29. 9 goes into 29 three times, 3 times 9 is 27. Subtract 27 from 29 to get 2.\n\nSo, 119 divided by 9 is 13 with a remainder of 2.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 12 with a remainder of 11, but that can't be right because 9 times 12 is 108, and 119 minus 108 is 11, but that's different from what I just did.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm confusing myself. Let me try to double-check.\n\nLet's see, 9 times 13 is 117, because 9 times 10 is 90, 9 times 3 is 27, 90 plus 27 is 117. Then, 119 minus 117 is 2.\n\nSo, yes, 119 divided by 9 is 13 with a remainder of 2.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 9 times 12 is 108, and 119 minus 108 is 11, which seems inconsistent now.\n\nI think I made a mistake in my initial thought process. Let's clarify.\n\nIf 9 times 12 is 108, and 119 minus 108 is 11, that would suggest that 119 divided by 9 is 12 with a remainder of 11. But, in reality, since 9 times 13 is 117, which is closer to 119, with a remainder of 2.\n\nSo, I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the correct division is 119 divided by 9 equals", "answer": "13", "equiv": false}, {"output": "14280", "answer": "14280", "equiv": true}, {"output": "23", "answer": "23", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this problem here: Tayli gives out packs of 13 red flyers to each restaurant owner and sets of 20 blue flyers to each clothing store owner.

She gives 13 red flyers to each restaurant and 20 blue flyers to each clothing store. And at the end, the total number of red flyers equals the total number of blue flyers.\n\nSo, let\u2019s define some variables. Let\u2019s say she gave flyers to R restaurants and C clothing stores.\n\nThen, the total red flyers would be 13R and the total blue flyers would be 20C.\n\nAnd according to the problem, 13R = 20C.\n\nI need to find the smallest possible values of R and C that satisfy this equation.\n\nThis seems like a problem involving least common multiples or maybe finding the smallest integer solution to this equation.\n\nSo, 13R = 20C.\n\nI need to find the smallest positive integers R and C that make this true.\n\nOne way to approach this is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 20.\n\nFirst, let's find the LCM of 13 and 20.\n\n13 is a prime number, and 20 is 2^2 * 5.\n\nSo, LCM(13,20) = 13 * 2^2 * 5 = 13 * 4 * 5 = 52 * 5 = 260.\n\nSo, the LCM is 260.\n\nNow, to find R and C:\n\n13R = 20C = 260.\n\nSo, R = 260 / 13 = 20.\n\nAnd C = 260 / 20 = 13.\n\nSo, she gave flyers to 20 restaurants and 13 clothing stores.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of flyers of each color distributed is 260.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the minimum number of flyers of each color, which is the same for both red and blue, so it's 260.\n\nBut let's double-check if there's a smaller number that satisfies 13R = 20C.\n\nSuppose there is a smaller common multiple.\n\nWell, 13 and 20 are coprime because 13 is prime and doesn't divide 20.\n\nWait, 13 doesn't divide 20, that's correct.\n\nSo, the smallest R and C should be as above.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of multiples.\n\nR has to be a multiple of 20, and C a multiple of 13, to make 13R = 20C.\n\nWait, actually, no.\n\nLet's think about it differently.\n\n13R = 20C.\n\nSo, R must be a multiple of 20/ gcd(13,20), but gcd(13,20) is 1, since 13 is prime and doesn't divide 20.\n\nSimilarly, C must be a multiple of 13/ gcd(13,20) = 13.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for the smallest solution.\n\nIf aX = bY, then the smallest X and Y are LCM(a,b)/a and LCM(a,b)/b, respectively.\n\nWhich is what I did earlier.\n\nSo, R = LCM(13,20)/13 = 260/13 = 20.\n\nC = LCM(13,20)/20 = 260/20 = 13.\n\nSo, the minimum number of flyers is 13*20 = 260.\n\nWait, but 13*20 is 260, yes.\n\nAlternatively, 20*13 is also 260.\n\nSo, it checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the number of red flyers is 13R and blue is 20C, and they are equal, so 13R = 20C.\n\nI need to find the smallest positive integer solutions for R and C.\n\nSo, 13R = 20C.\n\nR/C = 20/13.\n\nSo, the smallest integers R and C that satisfy this ratio are R=20 and C=13.\n\nWhich again gives 13*20 = 260 flyers for each color.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of multiples.\n\nMultiples of 13: 13,26,39,52,65,", "answer": "260", "equiv": false}, {"output": "55^\\circ, 110^\\circ, 15^\\circ", "answer": "88", "equiv": false}, {"output": "42", "answer": "42", "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": "8", "equiv": true}, {"output": "53", "answer": "53", "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's see what's going on here with Oliver and his books.

So, 54 + 108 = 162.\n\nWait, that also gives me 162.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same number, 162.\n\nBut the first method, multiplying by 3 each time, seems simpler and more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a quadratic sequence or something, but that seems unnecessary here.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nIs there a general formula for the number of books on the nth shelf?\n\nIf the pattern is multiplying by 3 each time, starting from 2, then it's a geometric sequence where the first term a = 2 and the common ratio r = 3.\n\nThe general formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is a * r^(n-1).\n\nSo, for the 1st shelf: 2 * 3^(1-1) = 2 * 3^0 = 2 * 1 = 2.\n\n2nd shelf: 2 * 3^(2-1) = 2 * 3^1 = 6.\n\n3rd shelf: 2 * 3^(3-1) = 2 * 3^2 = 18.\n\n4th shelf: 2 * 3^(4-1) = 2 * 3^3 = 54.\n\n5th shelf: 2 * 3^(5-1) = 2 * 3^4 = 2 * 81 = 162.\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the additions: 4, 12, 36, 108, which is also a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nSo, both approaches lead to the same conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the number of books on the 5th shelf should be 162.\n\nWait a minute, just to be thorough, maybe there's another pattern I haven't considered.\n\nLet's see: perhaps it's related to powers of 3, plus or minus something.\n\n1st shelf: 2 = 3^1 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2.\n\n2nd shelf: 6 =", "answer": "162", "equiv": false}, {"output": "36 \\text{ cents}", "answer": "36", "equiv": false}, {"output": "8.25", "answer": "8", "equiv": false}, {"output": "8", "answer": "7", "equiv": false}, {"output": "19", "answer": "19", "equiv": true}, {"output": "32", "answer": "32", "equiv": true}, {"output": "24", "answer": "24", "equiv": true}, {"output": "45", "answer": "45", "equiv": true}, {"output": "46", "answer": "46", "equiv": true}, {"output": "56", "answer": "56", "equiv": true}, {"output": "128", "answer": "128", "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": "4", "equiv": true}, {"output": "64", "answer": "64", "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": "3", "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's see what's going on here.

We need to figure out how many he'll pick from the sixth bush if the pattern continues.\n\nFirst, I should try to identify the pattern. Let's look at the differences between consecutive numbers:\n\n- Second bush minus first bush: 22 - 18 = 4\n\n- Third bush minus second bush: 26 - 22 = 4\n\n- Fourth bush minus third bush: 30 - 26 = 4\n\n- Fifth bush minus fourth bush: 34 - 30 = 4\n\nHmm, it looks like he's picking 4 more flowers each time he moves to the next bush.

We have two lights:\n\n- Light A flickers every 7 seconds.\n\n- Light B flickers every 8 seconds.\n\nThey both just flickered at the same time, and I need to find out when they'll both flicker together again.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem involving least common multiples, or LCMs, because we're dealing with events that repeat at regular intervals and we want to find the next time they coincide.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an LCM is. The least common multiple of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them.\n\nSo, in this case, the LCM of 7 and 8 would give me the smallest amount of time after which both lights will flicker together again.\n\nLet me make sure I understand this. If Light A flickers every 7 seconds, its flicker times would be at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, and so on seconds.\n\nSimilarly, Light B flickers every 8 seconds, so its flicker times are at 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, and so on seconds.\n\nLooking at these sequences, I can see that the first time they both flicker together after time zero is at 56 seconds. So, is the LCM of 7 and 8 equal to 56?\n\nTo confirm, I can calculate the LCM of 7 and 8.\n\nFirst, I can list the multiples of each:\n\nMultiples of 7: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, ...\n\nMultiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, ...\n\nThe smallest number that appears in both lists is 56, so yes, LCM(7,8) = 56.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the LCM using the formula that involves the greatest common divisor (GCD):\n\nLCM(a,b) = (a * b) / GCD(a,b)\n\nSo, I need to find the GCD of 7 and 8.\n\n7 and 8 are consecutive integers, and since they are both greater than 1, their GCD is 1.\n\nTherefore, LCM(7,8) = (7 * 8) / 1 = 56\n\nThis confirms my earlier observation.\n\nWait a minute, is there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe using the concept of cycles or something else?\n\nLet's think about it differently. Suppose I consider the time intervals between consecutive flickers for each light.\n\nLight A: every 7 seconds.\n\nLight B: every 8 seconds.\n\nIf they both flicker at time zero, then the next time they both flicker together would be at the first time that is a multiple of both 7 and 8, which is indeed the LCM.\n\nSo, I think using LCM is the correct approach here.\n\nIs there any chance that the answer could be less than 56 seconds? Let's see.\n\nIf I consider 28 seconds, which is a multiple of 7, but not of 8.\n\nAt 28 seconds, Light A flickers, but Light B doesn't flicker until 32 seconds.\n\nSimilarly, at 32 seconds, Light B flickers, but Light A flickers at 35 seconds.\n\nAt 42 seconds, Light A flickers, but Light B flickers at 40 and 48 seconds.\n\nAt 48 seconds, Light B flickers, but Light A flickers at 49 and 56 seconds.\n\nFinally, at 56 seconds, both flicker together.\n\nSo, indeed, 56 seconds is the soonest they both flicker together again.\n\nWait, is there a possibility that they could flicker together again before 56 seconds if they have overlapping flicker periods?\n\nLet's think about it.

That means each holder should have the same number of forks and the same number of knives, and there should be no forks or knives remaining.\n\nSo, if I have 'n' holders, each holder would have 'f' forks and 'k' knives, and the total number of forks would be n*f = 12, and the total number of knives would be n*k = 16.\n\nI need to find the greatest possible value for n such that both 12 and 16 are divisible by n without any remainder.\n\nThis sounds like I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 16, because the GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers evenly.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD of two numbers. One way is to list all the divisors of each number and find the largest one that's common to both.\n\nFirst, list the divisors of 12:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nNow, list the divisors of 16:\n\n1, 2, 4, 8, 16.\n\nNow, find the common divisors:\n\n1, 2, 4.\n\nThe greatest common divisor is 4.\n\nSo, the greatest number of silverware holders Shelley can stock is 4.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nIf she has 4 holders, each holder would have 12/4 = 3 forks and 16/4 = 4 knives. That's equal distribution with no items left over.\n\nIs there a way to have more than 4 holders? Let's see.\n\nIf I try 5 holders, then 12 divided by 5 is 2.4 forks per holder, which isn't possible since you can't have a fraction of a fork. Similarly, 16 divided by 5 is 3.2 knives per holder, which also isn't possible.\n\nWhat about 3 holders?\n\n12/3 = 4 forks per holder, and 16/3 = 5.333 knives per holder, which again isn't whole.\n\nWait, 16 divided by 3 is not a whole number, so that won't work.\n\nWhat about 2 holders?\n\n12/2 = 6 forks per holder, and 16/2 = 8 knives per holder. That works, but it's less than 4 holders.\n\nAnd 1 holder: 12 forks and 16 knives, which is obviously possible but not maximizing the number of holders.\n\nSo, 4 holders seems to be the maximum number where each holder gets an equal whole number of forks and knives.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the problem in terms of pairs of forks and knives.\n\nBut wait, the holders don't necessarily have to have the same number of forks and knives, just the same number of each type across all holders.\n\nWait, the problem says \"distributed equally,\" but it doesn't specify that each holder has the same number of forks and knives, just that the forks and knives are distributed equally among the holders.\n\nMaybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \"She wants to distribute them equally, with no forks or knives left over.\"\n\nIt seems like each holder should have the same number of forks and the same number of knives.\n\nWait, but maybe it's that the ratio of forks to knives is the same in each holder.\n\nBut no, it says distributed equally, which probably means each holder has the same number of forks and the same number of knives.\n\nIn that case, my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"distributed equally\" means that each holder has the same total number of items, regardless of the type.\n\nBut I think the former interpretation is better, given the wording.\n\nLet me consider both interpretations.\n\nFirst interpretation: each holder has the same number of forks and the same number of knives.\n\nSecond interpretation: each holder has the same total number of items, with possibly different numbers of forks and knives in each holder.\n\nI think the first interpretation is more aligned with \"distributed equally\" in this context.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider both.\n\nFirst interpretation:\n\nEach holder has 'f' forks and 'k' knives.\n\nTotal forks: n*f = 12\n\nTotal knives: n*k = 16\n\nn must divide both 12 and 16, so n is a common divisor of 12 and 16.\n\nThe greatest such n is the GCD of 12 and 16, which is 4.\n\nSecond interpretation", "answer": "4", "equiv": false}, {"output": "50", "answer": "50", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: the school cafeteria serves tacos every sixth day and cheeseburgers every eighth day.

Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about finding out when both tacos and cheeseburgers will be served on the same day again, starting from today. Since tacos are served every 6th day and cheeseburgers every 8th day, I think I need to find a common multiple of 6 and 8 that will tell me after how many days both will coincide.\n\nI recall that to find when two periodic events coincide, you need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their periods. So, in this case, the period for tacos is 6 days, and for cheeseburgers, it's 8 days. Therefore, finding the LCM of 6 and 8 should give me the number of days until both are served again on the same day.\n\nLet me remember how to find the LCM of two numbers. One way is to list the multiples of each number until I find the smallest one they have in common.

So, the LCM of 6 and 8 is 24. That means that in 24 days, both tacos and cheeseburgers will be on the menu again on the same day.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to find the LCM that might be more efficient, especially for larger numbers? Yes, I think I've learned that you can find the LCM using the prime factorization method.\n\nLet me try that. First, find the prime factors of each number.\n\n6 can be factored into 2 \u00d7 3.\n\n8 can be factored into 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, or 2^3.\n\nTo find the LCM, you take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations.\n\nSo, for prime number 2, the highest power is 2^3 from 8.\n\nFor prime number 3, the highest power is 3^1 from 6.\n\nTherefore, LCM = 2^3 \u00d7 3^1 = 8 \u00d7 3 = 24.\n\nOkay, that matches what I found earlier by listing multiples. Good, it's consistent.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem? Maybe using the greatest common divisor (GCD)? I think there's a relationship between LCM and GCD of two numbers.\n\nYes, I recall that for any two integers a and b, LCM(a, b) \u00d7 GCD(a, b) = a \u00d7 b.\n\nSo, if I can find the GCD of 6 and 8, I can use that to find the LCM.\n\nLet's find the GCD of 6 and 8.\n\nThe divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\nThe divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, 8.\n\nThe greatest common divisor is 2, since it's the largest number that divides both 6 and 8.\n\nNow, using the formula: LCM(6, 8) = (6 \u00d7 8) / GCD(6, 8) = 48 / 2 = 24.\n\nAgain, I get 24 days.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can think about this in terms of modular arithmetic or something, but I think the LCM approach is the most straightforward for this problem.\n\nLet me double-check if there's any chance that the answer could be less than 24 days.\n\nIs there a smaller number of days where both tacos and cheeseburgers are served? Let's see, every 6th day for tacos and every 8th for cheeseburgers.\n\nSo, days when tacos are served: day 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, etc.\n\nDays when cheeseburgers are served: day 8, 16, 24, 32, etc.\n\nIndeed, the first common day is day 24. So, 24 days from today, both will be served again on the same day.\n\nWait, but the problem says that both are served today. So, today is day 0", "answer": "24", "equiv": false}, {"output": "1.50", "answer": "150", "equiv": true}, {"output": "1396", "answer": "1396", "equiv": true}, {"output": "9", "answer": "9", "equiv": true}, {"output": "34", "answer": "34", "equiv": true}, {"output": "288", "answer": "288", "equiv": true}, {"output": "40", "answer": "40", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: two wires, one is 448 cm long and the other is 616 cm long. I need to cut them into pieces of the same length without any leftover bits. And I have to find the greatest possible length for these pieces. Okay, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to cut them into pieces of the same length without any remainder. That means that the length of each piece has to be a divisor of both 448 cm and 616 cm. So, I'm looking for a common divisor of these two lengths.\n\nBut the problem says \"the greatest possible length.\" That means I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 448 and 616. Yeah, that makes sense because the GCD is the largest number that divides both amounts without leaving a remainder.\n\nSo, my task is to find the GCD of 448 and 616. I remember there are a few methods to find the GCD, like listing all the divisors or using the Euclidean algorithm. Listing all the divisors could be time-consuming for larger numbers, so maybe the Euclidean algorithm is a better way to go.\n\nLet me recall how the Euclidean algorithm works. It's based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. So, you can repeatedly replace the larger number with the difference between the two numbers until one of them becomes zero. The non-zero number at that point is the GCD.\n\nWait, more formally, the Euclidean algorithm states that GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a mod b), and you keep doing this until b is zero. The a at that point is the GCD.\n\nSo, let's apply that here. Let a = 616 and b = 448.\n\nFirst step: GCD(616, 448) = GCD(448, 616 mod 448).\n\nLet's calculate 616 mod 448. That's the remainder when 616 is divided by 448.\n\n616 divided by 448 is 1, since 448 * 1 = 448, and 616 - 448 = 168. So, 616 mod 448 = 168.\n\nSo now, GCD(448, 168).\n\nNext step: GCD(448, 168) = GCD(168, 448 mod 168).\n\nCalculate 448 mod 168.\n\n448 divided by 168 is 2, because 168 * 2 = 336, and 448 - 336 = 112. So, 448 mod 168 = 112.\n\nNow, GCD(168, 112).\n\nNext step: GCD(168, 112) = GCD(112, 168 mod 112).\n\nCalculate 168 mod 112.\n\n168 divided by 112 is 1, since 112 * 1 = 112, and 168 - 112 = 56. So, 168 mod 112 = 56.\n\nNow, GCD(112, 56).\n\nNext step: GCD(112, 56) = GCD(56, 112 mod 56).\n\nCalculate 112 mod 56.\n\n112 divided by 56 is 2, since 56 * 2 = 112, and 112 - 112 = 0. So, 112 mod 56 = 0.\n\nNow, GCD(56, 0).\n\nWhen we reach GCD(n, 0), it's n, because any number divided by 0 is itself, and 0 divided by any number is 0.\n\nSo, GCD(56, 0) = 56.\n\nTherefore, the greatest common divisor of 448 and 616 is 56 cm.\n\nThat means the greatest possible length for the pieces is 56 cm.\n\nWait, just to double-check, I can verify this by seeing if 56 cm divides both 448 cm and 616 cm without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet's divide 448 by 56: 56 * 8 = 448, so no remainder.\n\nNow, ", "answer": "56", "equiv": false}, {"output": "60", "answer": "60", "equiv": true}, {"output": "13", "answer": "13", "equiv": true}, {"output": "4764", "answer": "4764", "equiv": true}, {"output": "42", "answer": "42", "equiv": true}, {"output": "630", "answer": "630", "equiv": true}, {"output": "95", "answer": "95", "equiv": true}, {"output": "198", "answer": "198", "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": "6", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many passengers are on the bus that isn't fully occupied, given that a bus can hold 48 passengers and there are 1,230 students and teachers going on a field trip.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. There are 1,230 people in total, and each bus can carry 48 passengers. I need to find out how many passengers are on the bus that isn't full, assuming that as many buses as possible are filled to capacity.\n\nTo approach this, I think I should divide the total number of passengers by the capacity of one bus. That should tell me how many full buses there are and if there's a remainder, that would be the number of passengers on the bus that isn't full.\n\nSo, I'll divide 1,230 by 48.\n\nLet me do that calculation step by step.\n\nFirst, 48 times 25 is 1,200. Because 48 times 10 is 480, and 48 times 20 is 960, and 48 times 5 is 240, so 960 plus 240 is 1,200.\n\nNow, 1,230 minus 1,200 is 30.\n\nSo, there are 25 full buses, each with 48 passengers, and one bus with 30 passengers.\n\nTherefore, the number of passengers on the bus that is not fully occupied is 30.\n\nWait a minute, is there a possibility that there are multiple buses not fully occupied? I don't think so, because 1,230 divided by 48 gives a quotient of 25 with a remainder of 30, meaning only one bus isn't full.\n\nTo double-check, I can multiply 25 by 48 and add 30 to see if I get back to 1,230.\n\n25 times 48 is 1,200, plus 30 is 1,230. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could perform the division again to confirm.\n\n48 times 25 is 1,200, and 1,230 minus 1,200 is indeed 30.\n\nSo, it seems straightforward. The answer should be 30 passengers on the bus that isn't fully occupied.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's another way to approach this problem, just to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to see how many buses are needed in total.\n\nUsing the ceiling function, since you can't have a fraction of a bus, you'd need to round up to the next whole number.\n\nSo, 1,230 divided by 48 is 25.625.\n\nSince you can't have 0.625 of a bus, you need 26 buses in total.\n\n25 buses are full, and the 26th bus has the remaining passengers.\n\nTo find out how many passengers are on the 26th bus, I can subtract the number of passengers in the first 25 buses from the total number of passengers.\n\n25 buses times 48 passengers per bus is 1,200 passengers.\n\n1,230 minus 1,200 is 30 passengers.\n\nAgain, this confirms that there are 30 passengers on the bus that isn't fully occupied.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this?\n\nPerhaps I could use modular arithmetic.\n\n1,230 modulo 48 should give me the remainder, which would be the number of passengers on the last bus.\n\nLet me calculate 1,230 mod 48.\n\nFirst, find how many times 48 goes into 1,230.\n\nWe already know it's 25 times, with a remainder of 30.\n\nSo, 1,230 mod 48 is 30.\n\nThis again confirms the earlier result.\n\nI think it's clear that the answer is 30 passengers.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem.\n\nIs there a possibility that buses can have fewer passengers, or that not all buses are used to full capacity?\n\nThe problem states that a school of 1,230 students and teachers are going on a field trip, and buses can transport 48 passengers each.\n\nIt asks for the number of passengers on the bus that is not fully occupied.\n\nAssuming that as many buses as possible are filled to capacity, which makes sense for transportation logistics, then the remainder would be on the last bus.\n\nAlternatively, if buses were not filled to capacity for some reason, but the problem doesn't specify that, so I think it", "answer": "30", "equiv": false}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: Bob strikes the drums every 9 seconds and the cymbals every 12 seconds. He just struck both at the same time, and I need to figure out how many seconds will pass before he strikes them together again. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst off, I need to understand what's being asked. Bob is striking the drums and cymbals at different intervals: 9 seconds for drums and 12 seconds for cymbals. And sometimes, he strikes both at the same time. The question is, when will this happen again after the initial strike?\n\nI think this has to do with finding a common multiple of their striking intervals. Specifically, I think I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12 seconds. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. So, if I find the LCM of 9 and 12, that should tell me after how many seconds both striking patterns align again.\n\nLet me recall how to find the LCM of two numbers. One way is to list the multiples of each number until I find the smallest one they have in common.\n\nSo, multiples of 9 are: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, and so on.\n\nMultiples of 12 are: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, etc.\n\nLooking at these, the smallest number that appears in both lists is 36. So, the LCM of 9 and 12 is 36. That means that every 36 seconds, Bob will strike both the drums and the cymbals at the same time.\n\nWait a minute, is there a more efficient way to find the LCM without listing all the multiples? Especially for larger numbers, that could be time-consuming. I remember that there's a formula that relates the LCM and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(a, b) = \\frac{a \\times b}{\\text{GCD}(a, b)} \\]\n\nSo, if I can find the GCD of 9 and 12, I can plug it into this formula to find the LCM.\n\nFirst, let's find the GCD of 9 and 12. The GCD is the largest number that divides both 9 and 12 without leaving a remainder.\n\nThe divisors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9.\n\nThe divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\nThe common divisors are 1 and 3, so the GCD is 3.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(9, 12) = \\frac{9 \\times 12}{3} = \\frac{108}{3} = 36 \\]\n\nSo, again, I get 36 seconds.\n\nIs there another way to confirm this? Maybe by using prime factorization.\n\nI know that every number can be expressed as a product of prime factors.\n\nLet's factorize 9 and 12.\n\n9 is \\(3^2\\), and 12 is \\(2^2 \\times 3\\).\n\nTo find the LCM using prime factors, I take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations.\n\nSo, for prime 2, the highest power is \\(2^2\\) (from 12).\n\nFor prime 3, the highest power is \\(3^2\\) (from 9).\n\nTherefore, the LCM is \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 = 4 \\times 9 = 36\\).\n\nAgain, I get 36 seconds.\n\nAlright, so all these methods point to 36 seconds being the answer.\n\nBut let me think about it in terms of the problem to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nBob strikes the drums every 9 seconds and the cymbals every 12 seconds. So, the times he strikes the drums are at 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, etc. seconds.\n\nThe times he strikes the cymbals are at 12, 24, 36, 48, etc. seconds.\n\nLooking at these sequences, they both strike at 36 seconds, which matches what I found earlier.\n\nIs there any chance that they could sync up earlier than 36 seconds?

Let's look at how the number of note cards is changing from one student to the next.\n\nStarting with the first student who got 3 note cards. The second student got 12. If I divide 12 by 3, I get 4. So, 3 multiplied by 4 is 12.\n\nNow, the third student got 48 note cards. If I divide 48 by 12, I get 4 again. So, 12 multiplied by 4 is 48.\n\nNext, the fourth student got 192 note cards. Dividing 192 by 48 gives me 4 once more. So, 48 multiplied by 4 is 192.\n\nHmm, it looks like each student is getting 4 times the number of note cards that the previous student received. So, the pattern is to multiply the previous term by 4 to get the next term.\n\nIf that's the case, then to find out how many note cards the fifth student will get, I should multiply the fourth student's note cards by 4.\n\nSo, 192 multiplied by 4.\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n192 \u00d7 4 = (100 \u00d7 4) + (90 \u00d7 4) + (2 \u00d7 4) = 400 + 360 + 8 = 768.\n\nSo, the fifth student should get 768 note cards.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, I can see if there's a formula that describes the number of note cards based on the student number.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the student number as n, starting from 1.\n\nSo,\n\n- When n=1, note cards = 3\n\n- n=2, note cards = 12\n\n- n=3, note cards = 48\n\n- n=4, note cards = 192\n\n- n=5, note cards = ?\n\nIf I look at these numbers, 3, 12, 48, 192, it seems like each term is multiplied by 4 to get the next one, as I thought earlier.\n\nSo, the general formula might be: note cards = 3 \u00d7 4^(n-1), where n is the student number.\n\nLet me test this formula with the given values.\n\nFor n=1: 3 \u00d7 4^(1-1) = 3 \u00d7 4^0 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=2: 3 \u00d7 4^(2-1) = 3 \u00d7 4^1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=3: 3 \u00d7 4^(3-1) = 3 \u00d7 4^2 = 3 \u00d7 16 = 48 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor n=4: 3 \u00d7 4^(4-1) = 3 \u00d7 4^3 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nLooks good so far. So, for n=5:\n\nNote cards = 3 \u00d7 4^(5-1) = 3 \u00d7 4^4 = 3 \u00d7 256 = 768.\n\nOkay, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me see if there's another pattern or if I'm missing something.\n\nIs there a possibility that the pattern is different, maybe involving addition or some other operation?\n\nLooking at the differences between the terms:\n\n- 12 - 3 = 9\n\n- 48 - 12 = 36\n\n- 192 - 48 = 144\n\nNow, looking at these differences: 9, 36, 144.\n\nIf I divide 36 by 9, I get 4, and 144 divided by 36 is also 4. So, the differences are multiplying by 4 each time.\n\nThis reinforces the idea that each term is 4 times the previous term.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the formula I came up with, note cards = 3 \u00d7 4^(n-1), it seems to fit perfectly with the given data.\n\nSo, I", "answer": "768", "equiv": false}, {"output": "80", "answer": "80", "equiv": true}, {"output": "22", "answer": "22", "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": "2", "equiv": true}, {"output": "12", "answer": "12", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So Billy has 650 pieces of candy, and he wants to split them into three bags with an equal number of candies in each bag.

Then bring down the 5. 3 goes into 5 one time (3*1=3), subtract that from 5, which leaves 2. Bring down the 0. 3 goes into 20 six times (3*6=18), subtract 18 from 20, which leaves 2.\n\nSo, 650 divided by 3 is 216 with a remainder of 2. That means if Billy puts 216 candies in each bag, he'll have 2 candies left over.\n\nBut he wants each bag to have the same amount, so he needs to have a number of candies that is divisible by 3 without any remainder.\n\nSince he has 2 candies left over, he needs enough additional candies to reach the next multiple of 3.\n\nThe next multiple of 3 after 650 would be 651, because 651 divided by 3 is 217 with no remainder.\n\nSo, to have 651 candies, he needs 1 more candy.\n\nBut let's check if there's a general way to find out how many more candies he needs.\n\nIf he has n candies and wants to divide them into 3 bags, he needs n to be divisible by 3.\n\nIf n divided by 3 leaves a remainder of r, then he needs 3 - r more candies to reach the next multiple of 3, except when r=0, in which case he doesn't need any more candies.\n\nIn this case, 650 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2, so he needs 3 - 2 = 1 more candy.\n\nWait, but let's verify this.\n\nIf he has 650 candies and adds 1 more, he has 651, which is divisible by 3 (217*3=651).\n\nAlternatively, if he adds 2 more candies, he would have 652, which divided by 3 is 217 with a remainder of 1, which is not evenly divisible.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.

Let me look back.\n\n\"The band wants to set up tables to sell the shirts, with an equal number of men's and women's shirts available at each table and no shirts left over.\"\n\nSo, each table must have the same number of men's shirts as women's shirts, and no shirts left over.\n\nSo, for each table, the number of men's shirts should be equal to the number of women's shirts.\n\nLet me denote the number of shirts per table as \\( s \\), so each table has \\( s \\) men's shirts and \\( s \\) women's shirts.\n\nThen, the total number of men's shirts would be \\( s \\times \\text{number of tables} \\), and the same for women's shirts.\n\nGiven that we have 20 men's shirts and 8 women's shirts, we can set up the equations:\n\n\\( s \\times \\text{number of tables} = 20 \\) for men's shirts.\n\n\\( s \\times \\text{number of tables} = 8 \\) for women's shirts.\n\nSince both equations equal \\( s \\times \\text{number of tables} \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\n\\( 20 = 8 \\), which is not possible unless \\( s \\) and the number of tables are adjusted accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that the number of tables must divide both the number of men's shirts and the number of women's shirts, and that the number of men's shirts per table equals the number of women's shirts per table.\n\nActually, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of men's and women's shirts.\n\nThe GCD of 20 and 8 is the largest number that divides both 20 and 8 without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet me calculate the GCD of 20 and 8.\n\nThe divisors of 20 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.\n\nThe divisors of 8 are: 1, 2, 4, 8.\n\nThe common divisors are: 1", "answer": "4", "equiv": false}, {"output": "2", "answer": "2", "equiv": true}, {"output": "30", "answer": "30", "equiv": true}, {"output": "66", "answer": "66", "equiv": true}, {"output": "0", "answer": "0", "equiv": true}, {"output": "45", "answer": "45", "equiv": true}, {"output": "400", "answer": "400", "equiv": true}, {"output": "9", "answer": "9", "equiv": true}, {"output": "48", "answer": "48", "equiv": true}, {"output": "24", "answer": "24", "equiv": true}, {"output": "11", "answer": "11", "equiv": true}, {"output": "18", "answer": "18", "equiv": true}, {"output": "51", "answer": "51", "equiv": true}, {"output": "19", "answer": "19", "equiv": true}, {"output": "1035", "answer": "1035", "equiv": true}, {"output": "11", "answer": "11", "equiv": true}, {"output": "41", "answer": "41", "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": "5", "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": "3", "equiv": true}, {"output": "77", "answer": "77", "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": "10", "equiv": true}, {"output": "612", "answer": "612", "equiv": true}, {"output": "13", "answer": "13", "equiv": true}, {"output": "34", "answer": "34", "equiv": true}, {"output": "63", "answer": "63", "equiv": true}, {"output": "20", "answer": "20", "equiv": true}, {"output": "66", "answer": "66", "equiv": true}, {"output": "11", "answer": "11", "equiv": true}, {"output": "52", "answer": "52", "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": "10", "equiv": true}, {"output": "275", "answer": "275", "equiv": true}, {"output": "36", "answer": "36", "equiv": true}, {"output": "15", "answer": "15", "equiv": true}, {"output": "38", "answer": "38", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So Tom has 158 watches to fix, and he plans to fix them at a rate of 12 watches per day. I need to find out how many watches he will fix on the last day.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many full days he will work, fixing 12 watches each day, and then see if there are any watches left over for the last day.\n\nTo do that, I can divide the total number of watches by the number he fixes per day. So, 158 divided by 12.\n\nLet me do that division step by step.\n\n12 times 12 is 144. That's because 12 x 12 = 144.\n\nNow, 158 minus 144 is 14.\n\nSo, after fixing 12 watches per day for 12 days, there are 14 watches left.\n\nTherefore, on the last day, he will fix those remaining 14 watches.\n\nWait a minute, but I should make sure that 12 days is correct.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n12 days x 12 watches/day = 144 watches.\n\nTotal watches are 158, so 158 - 144 = 14 watches.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could use division to find the number of full days and the remainder.\n\nSo, 158 divided by 12 is 13 with a remainder of 2.\n\nWait, that doesn't match my previous calculation.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\n12 times 13 is 156.\n\n158 - 156 = 2.\n\nSo, according to this, he would fix 12 watches per day for 13 days, and then 2 watches on the last day.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 12 days and 14 watches left.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I thought 12 days x 12 = 144, and 158 - 144 = 14.\n\nBut if I consider 13 days x 12 = 156, and 158 - 156 = 2.\n\nSo, the correct number of full days is 13, with 2 watches left for the last day.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my first calculation.\n\nYes, 12 days x 12 = 144, but 13 days x 12 = 156, which is closer to 158.\n\nSo, 158 - 156 = 2.\n\nTherefore, on the last day, he will fix 2 watches.\n\nWait, but that seems too low compared to my first thought.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nI can use the division formula: total watches divided by watches per day gives the number of days needed.\n\nSo, 158 \u00f7 12 = 13.1666...\n\nThis means he needs 13 full days and a part of the 14th day.\n\nTo find out how many watches are left for the last day, I can calculate the total watches fixed in 13 days and subtract that from the total.\n\n13 days x 12 watches/day = 156 watches.\n\n158 - 156 = 2 watches.\n\nSo, on the last day, he fixes 2 watches.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the modulo operation to find the remainder.\n\n158 mod 12 = 2.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the number of watches he fixes on the last day is 2.\n\nBut, to make sure, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nSuppose he fixes 12 watches every day for as many days as possible, and then fixes the remaining watches on the last day.\n\nSo, day 1: 12 watches.\n\nDay 2: 12 watches.\n\n...\n\nDay 13: 12 watches.\n\nTotal so far: 13 x 12 = 156 watches.\n\nRemaining watches: 158 - 156 = 2.\n\nTherefore, on the last day, he fixes 2 watches.\n\nAlternatively, if he fixes fewer watches on some days, but the problem says he plans to fix them at a rate of 12 per day.\n\nSo, I think 2 watches on the last day is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but I have a feeling that maybe I miscounted somewhere.\n\nLet me try calculating it again.\n\nTotal watches: 158.\n\nWatches per day: 12.\n\nNumber of full days: 158 \u00f7 12 = 13.16", "answer": "2", "equiv": false}, {"output": "7", "answer": "7", "equiv": true}, {"output": "12", "answer": "12", "equiv": true}, {"output": "35", "answer": "35", "equiv": true}, {"output": "18", "answer": "18", "equiv": true}, {"output": "11", "answer": "11", "equiv": true}, {"output": "53", "answer": "53", "equiv": true}, {"output": "100", "answer": "100", "equiv": true}, {"output": "Okay, so Hugo had seventy-nine stickers initially, and after adding some more, he has one hundred twenty stickers now.

I think I need to subtract the number of stickers he had originally from the number he has now to find out how many he added.\n\nSo, it's one hundred twenty minus seventy-nine.\n\nLet me write that down: 120 - 79.\n\nHmm, how do I do this? I remember that when subtracting, I need to make sure I'm borrowing correctly if necessary.\n\nLet's see, starting from the units place: 0 minus 9. Oh, I can't do that because 0 is less than 9. So, I need to borrow from the tens place.\n\nBut the tens place in 120 is 2. If I borrow 1 from the hundreds place, which is 1, it becomes 0, and the tens place becomes 12.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. 120 is composed of 1 hundred, 2 tens, and 0 units.\n\nTo subtract 79, which is 7 tens and 9 units, I need to borrow because I can't subtract 9 from 0.\n\nSo, I'll borrow 1 from the tens place. But the tens place has 2, so if I borrow 1, the tens place becomes 1, and the units place becomes 10.\n\nThen, I can subtract 9 from 10, which is 1.\n\nNext, in the tens place, I have 1 minus 7, but again, 1 is less than 7, so I need to borrow from the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds place is 1, so if I borrow 1, it becomes 0, and the tens place becomes 11.\n\nNow, 11 minus 7 is 4.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 0 minus 0 is 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 120 - 79 = 41.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my steps again.\n\nStarting with 120.\n\nBorrow 1 from the tens place: tens place goes from 2 to 1, and units place goes from 0 to 10.\n\nThen, 10 - 9 = 1.\n\nNext, since the tens place is now 1, and I need to subtract 7, I borrow 1 from the hundreds place.\n\nHundreds place goes from 1 to 0, and tens place goes from 1 to 11.\n\nThen, 11 - 7 = 4.\n\nAnd 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nSo, 0 tens and 4 tens? Wait, that's confusing.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nMaybe I can think of it as 120 - 70 first, and then subtract the remaining 9.\n\nSo, 120 - 70 = 50.\n\nThen, 50 - 9 = 41.\n\nYeah, that matches what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, I could add up from 79 to 120.\n\nStarting at 79, add 1 to get to 80, which is 1.\n\nThen, from 80 to 120 is 40.\n\nSo, total added is 1 + 40 = 41.\n\nThat also gives me 41.\n\nLet me try another way to confirm.\n\nIf Hugo had 79 stickers and added some to make it 120, then 79 + x = 120.\n\nSo, x = 120 - 79.\n\nAgain, that's the same subtraction.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\n79 + 1 = 80\n\n80 + 40 = 120\n\nSo, total added is 1 + 40 = 41.\n\nOr, I can break it down:\n\n120 - 79 = (100 - 79) + 20 = 21 + 20 = 41.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, 100 - 79 is 21, and then adding 20 would make it 41, but that's not correct.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nActually, 120 is 100 + 20.\n\nSo, 100 - 79 is 21, and then adding 20 gives 41.\n\nBut that seems confusing.\n\nLet me try a different method.\n\nI can use the concept of compensation.\n\nSubtract 80 from 120, which is 40, and since 79 is one less than 8", "answer": "41", "equiv": false}, {"output": "7", "answer": "7", "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem about Alec putting flowers into vases, and there's a pattern to how many flowers he puts in each vase.
