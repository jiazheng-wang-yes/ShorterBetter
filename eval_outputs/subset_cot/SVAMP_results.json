So, the problem says: \"In a school there are 697 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 228 more girls than boys, how many boys are there in that school?\"\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked here. We know the number of girls, which is 697, and that there are 228 more girls than boys. We need to find out how many boys there are in the school.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. If there are more girls than boys by 228, that means if I take the number of boys and add 228 to it, I should get the number of girls. So, boys + 228 = girls.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Given that, and knowing the number of girls is 697, I can set up an equation to find the number of boys.\n\nLet's denote the number of boys as B. According to the problem:\n\nB + 228 = 697\n\nSo, to find B, I can subtract 228 from both sides of the equation:\n\nB = 697 - 228\n\nLet me do that calculation.\n\n697 minus 228:\n\n7 minus 8 can't be done, so I need to borrow 1 from the tens place. But the tens place is 9, so it becomes 8, and the units place becomes 17.\n\nNow, 17 minus 8 is 9.\n\nNext, 8 minus 2 is 6.\n\nFinally, 6 minus 2 is 4.\n\nSo, 697 - 228 = 469.\n\nTherefore, the number of boys is 469.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can use another approach to confirm this answer.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that the total number of students is the sum of girls and boys. But the problem doesn't give me the total number of students directly. However, since it says \"the rest are boys,\" that implies that total students = girls + boys.\n\nBut I don't think I need the total number to find the number of boys, since I already have a direct relationship between girls and boys.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of differences. The difference between the number of girls and boys is 228, and girls are 697.\n\nSo, boys = girls - 228.\n\nAgain, that brings me back to B = 697 - 228 = 469.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem. Maybe the \"rest are boys\" part is trying to say that after accounting for girls, the remaining students are boys.\n\nBut that's essentially what I did earlier.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's imagine that there are other students besides girls and boys, but the problem doesn't suggest that. It says \"the rest are boys,\" which implies that the entire student body consists only of girls and boys.\n\nSo, my initial approach should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up an equation using total students.\n\nLet\u2019s denote total students as T and boys as B.\n\nThen, T = girls + boys = 697 + B.\n\nBut I don't know T, so that doesn't help directly.\n\nWait, the problem also says there are 228 more girls than boys, which gives me another equation: girls = boys + 228.\n\nSince girls are 697, then 697 = B + 228.\n\nAgain, solving for B: B = 697 - 228 = 469.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nLet me try to check if 469 boys plus 228 equals the number of girls.\n\n469 + 228 = ?\n\n9 + 8 = 17, carry over 1.\n\n6 + 2 + 1 = 9.\n\n4 + 2 = 6.\n\nSo, 469 + 228 = 697, which matches the number of girls.\n\nPerfect, that confirms my answer.\n\nIs there any other way to look at this problem?\n\nSuppose I think about ratios or proportions, but the problem doesn't provide any information about ratios, so that might not be applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using algebraic expressions.\n\nLet\u2019s let B represent the number of boys.\n\nThen, girls = B + 228.\n\nBut girls are given as 697, so B + 228 = 697.\n\nSolving for B: B = 697 - 228 = 469.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think I've confirmed", "answer": 469, "equiv": false}, {"output": "1414", "answer": 1414, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here about Danny collecting bottle caps and wrappers.

The question is asking how many wrappers he had before he found the new ones at the park.\n\nLet me read it again to make sure I grasp all the details.\n\n\"Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 22 bottle caps and 30 wrappers at the park. Now he has 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers in his collection. How many wrappers did Danny have at first?\"\n\nHmm, this seems a bit confusing.

Maybe it's the total after removing some or something. But the problem says \"now he has\" after finding more items.\n\nWait, perhaps the 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers are not the total after adding the found items, but something else.

Now he has 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers in his collection. How many wrappers did Danny have at first?\"\n\nAlright, maybe the \"now he has\" refers to after he has added the found items to his collection.\n\nSo, let's define:\n\nLet \\( c \\) be the number of bottle caps Danny had initially.\n\nLet \\( w \\) be the number of wrappers Danny had initially.\n\nThen, he found 22 bottle caps and 30 wrappers at the park, so he added these to his collection.\n\nTherefore, his new total of bottle caps is \\( c + 22 \\), and his new total of wrappers is \\( w + 30 \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, after adding these, he has 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers.\n\nSo, we can set up the following equations:\n\n\\( c + 22 = 17 \\)\n\n\\( w + 30 = 57 \\)\n\nNow, we can solve these equations for \\( c \\) and \\( w \\).\n\nFirst, solving for \\( c \\):\n\n\\( c + 22 = 17 \\)\n\nSubtract 22 from both sides:\n\n\\( c = 17 - 22 \\)\n\n\\( c = -5 \\)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.

Is that relevant to the question being asked?\n\nMaybe it's providing additional context or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the problem is trying to ask how many more wrappers than bottle caps he has in his overall collection, not just what he found at the park.\n\nBut no, the question specifically says, \"How many more wrappers than bottle caps did Danny find at the park?\"\n\nSo, based on that, it should be 65 wrappers - 5 bottle caps = 60.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here. Maybe the \"now he has 31 bottle caps and 9 wrappers\" is supposed to be his total collection, including what he found at the park plus what he already had.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps I need to find out how many bottle caps and wrappers he had before finding the ones at the park.\n\nLet me explore that possibility.\n\nSuppose he had x bottle caps and y wrappers before going to the park.

Now he has 31 bottle caps and 9 wrappers in his collection.\"\n\nPerhaps the \"now\" refers to after he added the items found at the park to his collection. If that's the case, then his collection before going to the park had 31 - 5 = 26 bottle caps and 9 - 65 = -56 wrappers.\n\nAgain, negative wrappers don't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are supposed to be interpreted differently. Maybe the \"now he has 31 bottle caps and 9 wrappers\" is separate from what he found at the park.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is poorly worded, and I should just focus on the numbers he found at the park.\n\nIn that case, the difference is 65 - 5 = 60.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to ask how many more wrappers than bottle caps he has in his collection now.\n\nIf that's the case, then it would be 9 wrappers - 31 bottle caps = -22.\n\nBut negative values typically aren't asked for in such problems.\n\nWait, the question specifically asks for \"how many more wrappers than bottle caps did Danny find at the park?\"\n\nSo, it's about the items found at the park, not his overall collection.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 65 - 5 = 60.\n\nMaybe the information about his collection is just additional information that isn't needed to answer the question.\n\nIn that case, the answer is 60.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because of the inclusion of the collection information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to say", "answer": 60, "equiv": false}, {"output": "488", "answer": 488, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here.

I need to find out how many crackers and cakes each friend received.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what it means to give equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend. Does this mean that each friend gets the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes, and that these numbers are equal across all friends?\n\nWait, the problem says he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. So, perhaps each friend gets the same combination of crackers and cakes, but not necessarily the same number of crackers as cakes per friend.\n\nHmm, let me think again. The phrasing is a bit ambiguous. Let's look at it again: \"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends.\"\n\nThis could mean two things:\n\n1. Each friend received an equal number of crackers and an equal number of cakes, but not necessarily the same number of crackers as cakes.\n\n2. Each friend received the same number of crackers as cakes.\n\nI think the first interpretation makes more sense. So, each friend gets the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes, but the number of crackers per friend could be different from the number of cakes per friend.\n\nBut the problem also says \"equal numbers of crackers and cakes,\" which might suggest that the number of crackers given is equal to the number of cakes given in total. Wait, but he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially, which are different amounts.\n\nWait, maybe it means that he gave the same number of crackers and cakes in total to his friends combined.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's try rephrasing the problem.\n\nMatthew has 13 crackers and 15 cakes. He gives these to his 28 friends such that each friend receives an equal share of the crackers and an equal share of the cakes.\n\nSo, he distributes all the crackers equally among his 28 friends and all the cakes equally among his 28 friends.\n\nThat would make sense.\n\nSo, the total number of crackers is 13, and he's dividing them equally among 28 friends. Similarly, he's dividing 15 cakes equally among 28 friends.\n\nSo, each friend gets 13/28 of a cracker and 15/28 of a cake.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the number of crackers and cakes each person ate. Since 13/28 and 15/28 are fractions, it's possible that each friend received a fraction of a cracker and a fraction of a cake.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to interpret this. Perhaps Matthew gave whole numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend, but that doesn't seem possible because 13 crackers divided by 28 friends doesn't result in a whole number.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is implying that Matthew gave away all his crackers and cakes completely, but that doesn't seem right because 13 crackers can't be divided equally among 28 friends without breaking them into fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Matthew gave away some crackers and some cakes such that the number given to each friend is equal, but again, that's confusing.\n\nLet me try to approach this differently. Maybe I should consider the total number of crackers and cakes combined and then divide them equally among the friends.\n\nBut no, the problem specifies that he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends, not that the total number of crackers and cakes combined was divided equally.\n\nWait, perhaps he gave away the same number of crackers and cakes in total.

Maybe we're supposed to assume that the number of visitors is consistent each day, but that doesn't make sense because the numbers are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to say that normally there are a certain number of visitors per day, but on the previous day, there were 703, and on that day, there were 246, and we need to find the total over 25 days. This is still unclear.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem to make sense of it. It says, \"Rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If there were 246 visitors on that day. How many visited the Buckingham palace within 25 days?\"\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding in the wording. Maybe it's saying that on one particular day, there were 703 visitors, and on another day, there were 246 visitors, and we need to find the total visitors over 25 days. But without knowing the average number of visitors per day or some pattern, it's hard to determine the total for 25 days based on just these two days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that on the previous day, there were 703 visitors, and on the day they visited, there were 246 visitors, and we're supposed to find the total visitors over 25 days, assuming that the number of visitors is the same as on the day they visited. But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is incomplete or miswritten. Perhaps it's missing some information about the number of visitors per day or some other details that would help us solve it.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe the problem is saying that on the previous day, there were 703 visitors, and on the day they visited, there were 246 visitors, and we need to find the total visitors over 25 days, assuming that the number of visitors varies between these two numbers. But without knowing the pattern or distribution, that's still not enough to find a precise answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about adding up the visitors over 25 days, and the numbers 703 and 246 are just examples or perhaps the number of visitors on two of those days. If that's the case, then we would need to know the number of visitors for all 25 days to find the total.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, as it would be impractical to list the number of visitors for each of the 25 days. Maybe there's an average number of visitors per day that we can use. But again, the problem doesn't provide that information.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the problem is about adding the visitors from the previous day and the visitors from that day and then multiplying by the number of days. But that doesn't make much sense either.\n\nLet me try to look at this differently. Maybe there's a typo in the problem, and it's supposed to say that the palace was open for 25 days, with 703 visitors on the previous day and 246 on that day, and we need to find the total visitors. But still, that doesn't give me enough information to find a total without knowing the visitors on the other days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem", "answer": 949, "equiv": false}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the problem is about the \"crazy silly school\" series, and there are some books and movies in it. It says there are 8 different books and 5 different movies. Then, it mentions that you read 19 of the movies and watched 16 of the books. Wait a minute, that seems a bit off because there are only 5 movies and 8 books. How can you read 19 movies if there are only 5? Maybe there's a mistake in the problem.\n\nLet me read it again: \"There are 8 different books and 5 different movies in the 'crazy silly school' series. If you read 19 of the movies and watched 16 of the books. How many more movies than books have you read?\"\n\nHmm, this is confusing. First, it says there are only 5 movies, but you read 19 of them. That's not possible unless you read some movies multiple times, but the problem doesn't mention that. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be \"you read 19 of the books and watched 16 of the movies.\" That would make more sense because there are 8 books, and 19 is more than 8, which could mean you read some books multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are switched between books and movies. I think I need to clarify what the problem is asking.\n\nLet's assume that the problem meant to say that there are 8 books and 5 movies, and you read some of the movies and watched some of the books, but the numbers provided exceed the total available. Maybe it's about reading books and watching movies multiple times.\n\nBut to solve this, I need to interpret the problem correctly. Perhaps it's a trick question where you can't read more movies than there are available, so you only read all 5 movies, not 19.\n\nWait, maybe the problem has a mistake, and the numbers are supposed to be smaller. Alternatively, maybe \"read\" and \"watched\" are mixed up.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem to make sense of it. Suppose there are 8 books and 5 movies. If you read some of the movies and watched some of the books, but the numbers given are 19 and 16, which are higher than the total available, perhaps it's about multiple viewings or readings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about how many more movies than books you have read, given that you read 19 movies and watched 16 books, but considering the total available.\n\nGiven that there are only 5 movies, you can't read 19 distinct movies; you might have read some multiple times. Similarly, there are only 8 books, and you watched 16 of them, which also implies watching some books multiple times.\n\nIf that's the case, then the number of movies you read is 19, and the number of books you watched is 16. The question is asking how many more movies than books you have read. So, it's 19 (movies read) minus 16 (books watched).\n\nSo, 19 - 16 = 3.\n\nTherefore, you have read 3 more movies than books.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation because of the confusion in the problem statement. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem meant that there are 8 books and 5 movies, and you have read some of them or watched some of them, but the numbers don't make sense as given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a problem about combinations or something else, but I don't think so.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll go with the straightforward approach: you read 19 movies and watched 16 books, so you read 3 more movies than books.\n\nSo, the answer should be 3.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another angle. Maybe the problem is about unique movies and books you have read and watched, given that there are only 5 movies and 8 books available.\n\nIn that case, you can't read more than 5 unique movies, so perhaps you read all 5 movies multiple times, but the problem might be considering unique titles.\n\nSimilarly, you can't watch more than 8 unique books, so you watched all 8 books multiple times.\n\nBut the problem says \"read 19 of the movies\" and \"watched 16 of the books.\" If \"of the movies\" means unique movies, then you can't read more than 5 unique movies, but perhaps \"read 19 of the movies\" means you read movies 19 times in total, possibly repeating some movies multiple times.\n\nSimilarly, \"watched 16 of the books\" might mean you watched books 16 times in total.\n\nBut the problem is asking for how many more movies", "answer": 3, "equiv": false}, {"output": "10", "answer": 10, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers.

Since he gained the same number of points in each round, I can multiply the number of rounds by the points per round to get the total points.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nTotal points = Number of rounds \u00d7 Points per round\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal points = 177 \u00d7 46\n\nNow, I need to calculate 177 multiplied by 46.

Maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that she has 43 friends and she wants to make necklaces for all of them, and she had 20 beads to start with and was able to make 5 necklaces, and now she needs to find out how many beads each necklace requires, considering she needs to make 43 necklaces in total.\n\nBut that seems complicated, and it's not clear from the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to say that she has 43 friends and she has 20 beads, and she was able to make 5 necklaces, and now she needs to find out how many beads per necklace, and perhaps there's a relationship between the number of friends and the number of necklaces.\n\nWait, maybe the number of friends is equal to the number of necklaces she needs to make, and the 20 beads and 5 necklaces are just to determine the number of beads per necklace.\n\nIn that case, if she made 5 necklaces with 20 beads, then each necklace requires 4 beads, as before.\n\nTherefore, for 43 necklaces, she would need 43 times 4 beads, which is 172 beads.\n\nBut again, the question is only asking for how many beads each necklace needs, which is 4, but the answer provided is 11.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem or in the provided answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is being interpreted incorrectly.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Emily is making bead necklaces for her 43 friends.

How many beads did each necklace need?\"\n\nPerhaps it's implying that she needs to make 43 necklaces, and she had 20 beads to make 5", "answer": 4, "equiv": false}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. So, the problem says: \"A waiter had 12 customers. After some left, he still had 14 customers. Then he got 10 new customers. How many customers does he have now?\"\n\nWait a minute, this seems a bit tricky. The waiter starts with 12 customers, some leave, and somehow he ends up with 14. Then he gets 10 more. Hmm, how is that possible? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the waiter has 12 customers. Then, some customers leave. Let's say x customers leave. So, 12 minus x should equal 14, right? But 12 - x = 14 doesn't make sense because if you subtract something from 12, you can't get 14. That would mean x is negative, which doesn't make sense in this context. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem or in my approach.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"A waiter had 12 customers. After some left, he still had 14 customers. Then he got 10 new customers. How many customers does he have now?\"\n\nWait, maybe I misread it. Maybe it's not that some customers left, but rather that he had 12 customers and then some joined, making it 14, and then another 10 joined. But the problem says \"after some left he still had 14 customers.\" That seems impossible starting from 12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the waiter had 12 customers at one table and some other customers at another table. Then some left, and he still had 14 in total. But that seems complicated. Let's consider that maybe there are customers at different tables.\n\nSuppose the waiter has 12 customers at one table and y customers at another table. Then some customers leave, say z customers leave from one of the tables, and after that, he has 14 customers in total. Then he gets 10 new customers. Let's try to set up equations for this.\n\nInitial total customers: 12 + y\n\nAfter z customers leave: 12 + y - z = 14\n\nThen he gets 10 new customers: 14 + 10 = 24\n\nSo, the final number of customers is 24. But let's check if this makes sense.\n\nFrom the equation: 12 + y - z = 14\n\nSo, y - z = 14 - 12 = 2\n\nTherefore, y - z = 2\n\nThen, after getting 10 new customers: 14 + 10 = 24\n\nSo, the final number is 24 customers.\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way to think about this. Maybe the waiter had 12 customers, some left, leaving him with 14, which doesn't make sense, unless there are customers at multiple tables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Maybe it's supposed to be that he had 12 customers, some joined, making it 14, and then another 10 joined.\n\nLet me consider that possibility.\n\nStarting with 12 customers, some join, making it 14: so, 12 + x = 14, therefore x = 2.\n\nThen, another 10 join: 14 + 10 = 24.\n\nSo, in this case, the final number is 24.\n\nAlternatively, if we stick to the original interpretation where some left, going from 12 to 14, which is unclear, but perhaps there are customers at multiple tables.\n\nFor example, suppose the waiter has 12 customers at table A and 10 customers at table B, totaling 22 customers. Then, some leave, say 8 leave from table B, so table B now has 2 customers. Therefore, total customers now are 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nThen, he gets 10 new customers, perhaps all sitting at table C. So, total customers are now 12 (table A) + 2 (table B) + 10 (table C) = 24.\n\nThis matches the previous conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 24.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the initial number of customers as 12.\n\nLet y be the number of customers he had elsewhere.\n\nAfter some left, he had 14 customers in total.\n\nThen, he got 10 new customers.\n\nWe need to find the final number of customers.\n\nFrom the initial setup:\n\nInitial customers: 12 + y\n\nAfter some left: 12 + y - z = 14\n\nThen, after getting 10 new customers:", "answer": 24, "equiv": false}, {"output": "204", "answer": 204, "equiv": true}, {"output": "20", "answer": 20, "equiv": true}, {"output": "31", "answer": 31, "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": 10, "equiv": true}, {"output": "61", "answer": 61, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this math problem here. Let's see what it's asking. A waiter had 12 customers. Then, 15 customers left, and he got 14 new customers. I need to find out how many customers he still has.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. Starting with 12 customers, that's my initial number. Then, 15 customers left. Hmm, if 15 customers leave, but he only had 12 to begin with, that seems a bit tricky. He can't have negative customers, right?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about this differently. Maybe the problem means that he had 12 tables or something, and then 15 customers left from those tables, but that doesn't make complete sense either. Or perhaps it's a typo, and it should be 15 customers arrived instead of left.\n\nBut let's assume the problem is stated correctly. So, starting with 12 customers, 15 leave, and then 14 new ones come in. How do I calculate that?\n\nFirst, he had 12 customers. Then 15 left. So, 12 minus 15 would be 12 - 15 = -3. Wait, negative three customers? That doesn't make sense in reality, but maybe in the context of the problem, it's okay.\n\nThen, he gets 14 new customers. So, -3 + 14 = 11. So, he has 11 customers left.\n\nBut does it make sense to have negative customers? Probably not in a real-world scenario, but maybe in this problem, it's just about doing the arithmetic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that he had 12 customers, then 15 new customers came in, and then 14 left. That would make more sense. Starting with 12, plus 15 is 27, minus 14 is 13.\n\nBut according to the problem, it says \"while 15 customers left he got 14 new customers.\" So, it sounds like the 15 left and 14 arrived at the same time.\n\nSo, starting with 12, minus 15 is -3, plus 14 is 11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"while 15 customers left, he got 14 new customers.\" So, perhaps it's happening at the same time. So, the net change is -15 + 14 = -1, applied to the initial 12.\n\nSo, 12 + (-1) = 11.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, the final number of customers is 11.\n\nWait, but again, having negative customers doesn't make sense. Maybe the problem is poorly worded.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he had 12 customers, then 15 new customers came in, making it 12 + 15 = 27, and then 14 left, 27 - 14 = 13.\n\nBut the problem says \"while 15 customers left, he got 14 new customers.\" So, it's a simultaneous event.\n\nMaybe it's better to think of it as a net change of 14 - 15 = -1 customer.\n\nSo, starting with 12, plus net change of -1, equals 11.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"while 15 customers left, he got 14 new customers.\" So, perhaps some customers are leaving and others are arriving at the same time.\n\nBut in terms of calculating the final number, it's still a net loss of 1 customer.\n\nSo, 12 - 1 = 11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is meant to be interpreted differently.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSuppose he starts with 12 customers.\n\nThen, 15 customers leave. So, 12 - 15 = -3.\n\nBut negative customers don't make sense. Maybe it means he has 0 customers, and 14 new ones come in, so he has 14.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the first calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is meant to be 12 + 15 - 14.\n\nWait, but that would be starting with 12, adding 15, getting 27, then subtracting 14, getting 13.\n\nBut the problem says \"while 15 customers left, he got 14 new customers.\"\n\nSo, perhaps it's meant to be simultaneous, meaning the net change is 14 - 15 = -1, applied to the initial 12, giving 11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's meant to be 12 - 15 = -3, then -3 + 14 = 1", "answer": 11, "equiv": false}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the recipe calls for 11 cups of flour and 7 cups of sugar. Mary has already put in some cups of flour, but we don't know how much yet. The problem says that she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar. We need to find out how many cups of flour she has already put in.\n\nFirst, let's understand what's been given:\n\n- Total flour required: 11 cups\n\n- Total sugar required: 7 cups\n\n- She has already put in some flour, let's call this amount x cups.\n\n- She still needs to add some flour and sugar, and the amount of flour she still needs is 2 cups more than the amount of sugar she still needs.\n\nSo, the amount of flour she still needs to add is: 11 - x cups.\n\nThe amount of sugar she still needs to add is: 7 - (amount of sugar already added). But the problem doesn't mention how much sugar she has already added, it only talks about the flour she has already added.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says \"she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar.\" This means that the amount of flour she still needs is 2 cups more than the amount of sugar she still needs.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation:\n\nAmount of flour still needed = amount of sugar still needed + 2\n\nWe already expressed the amount of flour still needed as 11 - x.\n\nBut what about the amount of sugar still needed? The recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar, but we don't know how much sugar she has already added. Maybe she hasn't added any sugar yet, or maybe she has added some. The problem doesn't specify.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let's read the problem again: \"She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 2 more cups of flour than sugar.\"\n\nWait, maybe she has added some flour and no sugar yet. Or perhaps she has added both, but we need to find a relationship between them.\n\nLet's assume that she has only added flour so far and hasn't added any sugar yet. That might simplify things.\n\nSo, if she hasn't added any sugar yet, the amount of sugar she still needs is 7 cups.\n\nAccording to the problem, the amount of flour she still needs is 2 cups more than the sugar she still needs. So, flour still needed = 7 + 2 = 9 cups.\n\nIf the total flour required is 11 cups, and she still needs 9 cups, that means she has already put in 11 - 9 = 2 cups of flour.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.\n\nTotal flour required: 11 cups\n\nFlour already put in: 2 cups\n\nFlour still needed: 9 cups\n\nSugar still needed: 7 cups\n\nIs 9 cups of flour still needed equal to 2 more than the sugar still needed? Yes, because 7 + 2 = 9.\n\nSo, this seems to work.\n\nBut wait, maybe she has already added some sugar as well. The problem says \"she already put in some cups of flour,\" but it doesn't say anything about sugar. It's possible that she has added some sugar already.\n\nIf she has added some sugar, then the amount of sugar still needed would be less than 7 cups, and accordingly, the flour still needed would be 2 more than that.\n\nLet me consider that possibility.\n\nLet\u2019s say she has already added s cups of sugar.\n\nThen, sugar still needed = 7 - s cups.\n\nFlour still needed = (7 - s) + 2 = 9 - s cups.\n\nBut the total flour required is 11 cups, so flour already put in = 11 - (flour still needed) = 11 - (9 - s) = 2 + s cups.\n\nSo, flour already put in is 2 + s cups.\n\nBut the problem only says she put in some cups of flour, and doesn't mention how much sugar she has put in.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find out how many cups of flour she has put in, and it doesn't provide information about the sugar she has put in.\n\nThis seems like there might be multiple answers depending on how much sugar she has already added.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If she has added 0 cups of sugar, then sugar still needed is 7 cups, flour still needed is 9 cups, so flour already put in is 11 - 9 = 2 cups.\n\n- If she has added 1 cup of sugar, then sugar still needed is 6 cups, flour still needed is 8 cups, so flour already put in is 11 - 8 = 3 cups.\n\n- If she has added 2 cups of sugar, then sugar still needed is 5 cups, flour still needed is 7", "answer": 2, "equiv": false}, {"output": "139", "answer": 139, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "22", "answer": 22, "equiv": true}, {"output": "111", "answer": 111, "equiv": true}, {"output": "22090603", "answer": 22090603, "equiv": true}, {"output": "125", "answer": 125, "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": 8, "equiv": true}, {"output": "75", "answer": 75, "equiv": true}, {"output": "569", "answer": 569, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this math problem here: \"If each bag has 41 cookies and you had 53 bags of cookies. How many cookies would you have?\" Okay, so I need to find out the total number of cookies when there are 53 bags, and each bag contains 41 cookies.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's basically about finding the total quantity of cookies given the number of bags and the number of cookies per bag. This seems like a multiplication problem because I'm dealing with groups of items.\n\nSo, I have 53 bags, and each bag has 41 cookies. To find the total number of cookies, I should multiply the number of bags by the number of cookies per bag. That is, 53 times 41.\n\nNow, I need to calculate 53 multiplied by 41. I remember that multiplication can be a bit tricky with two two-digit numbers, so I should probably break it down into smaller steps to avoid mistakes.\n\nOne way to do this is to use the standard multiplication algorithm. I can write it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll write 53 on one line and 41 on another line, like this:\n\n```\n\n53\n\n\u00d741\n\n```\n\nNow, I'll multiply 53 by 1 (the ones place of 41), and then multiply 53 by 40 (the tens place of 41), and finally add those two results together.\n\nStarting with multiplying by 1:\n\n53 \u00d7 1 = 53\n\nNext, multiplying by 40:\n\n53 \u00d7 40 = 2120\n\nNow, I'll add those two products together:\n\n53 + 2120 = 2173\n\nSo, 53 times 41 equals 2173.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes I get a little confused with carrying over numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another method to verify this result. Let's try the distributive property of multiplication.\n\nI can think of 41 as 40 + 1, so:\n\n53 \u00d7 41 = 53 \u00d7 (40 + 1) = (53 \u00d7 40) + (53 \u00d7 1)\n\nWe already did 53 \u00d7 40 = 2120, and 53 \u00d7 1 = 53.\n\nAdding them together: 2120 + 53 = 2173\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result. Good.\n\nAnother way to verify is to break down 53 into 50 + 3 and multiply each part by 41, then add the results.\n\nSo, 50 \u00d7 41 and 3 \u00d7 41.\n\nFirst, 50 \u00d7 41:\n\n50 \u00d7 40 = 2000\n\n50 \u00d7 1 = 50\n\nSo, 2000 + 50 = 2050\n\nNext, 3 \u00d7 41:\n\n3 \u00d7 40 = 120\n\n3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n\nSo, 120 + 3 = 123\n\nNow, add those two results together: 2050 + 123 = 2173\n\nAgain, the same result. This gives me more confidence that 2173 is the correct total number of cookies.\n\nLet me just do one more check using a different method. Maybe I can use the lattice method for multiplication.\n\nFor the lattice method, I'll set up a 2x2 grid since both numbers have two digits.\n\nFirst, I'll place 53 on the top and 41 on the right side of the grid.\n\nThen, I'll multiply the digits and place the products in the grid cells, splitting them into tens and ones.\n\nSo, multiplying 5 (tens place of 53) by 4 (tens place of 41):\n\n5 \u00d7 4 = 20, so I'll place 2 in the tens place and 0 in the ones place of the top-left cell.\n\nNext, 5 \u00d7 1 = 5, so I'll place 0 in the tens place and 5 in the ones place of the top-right cell.\n\nThen, 3 \u00d7 4 = 12, so 1 in the tens place and 2 in the ones place of the bottom-left cell.\n\nFinally, 3 \u00d7 1 = 3, so 0 in the tens place and 3 in the ones place of the bottom-right cell.\n\nNow, I'll add diagonally:\n\nStarting from the bottom-right:\n\n3 is alone, so that's 3.\n\nNext diagonal: 2 + ", "answer": 2173, "equiv": false}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": 8, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4300", "answer": 4300, "equiv": true}, {"output": "24", "answer": 24, "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": 7, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "687", "answer": 687, "equiv": true}, {"output": "20", "answer": 20, "equiv": true}, {"output": "30", "answer": 30, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "17", "answer": 17, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "22", "answer": 22, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "366", "answer": 366, "equiv": true}, {"output": "22", "answer": 22, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "12", "answer": 12, "equiv": true}, {"output": "30", "answer": 30, "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": 7, "equiv": true}, {"output": "15", "answer": 15, "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": 10, "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": 8, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "154", "answer": 154, "equiv": true}, {"output": "39", "answer": 39, "equiv": true}, {"output": "96", "answer": 96, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: During summer break, 800,059 kids from Lawrence County go to camp and the rest stay home.

There are a total of 828,521 kids in Lawrence County, and out of these, 800,059 go to camp. The rest stay home, and I need to find out how many that is.\n\nThis seems like a straightforward subtraction problem. I just need to subtract the number of kids who go to camp from the total number of kids in the county.\n\nSo, the calculation should be:\n\nTotal kids - kids who go to camp = kids who stay home\n\nThat is:\n\n828,521 - 800,059 = ?\n\nLet me do this subtraction step by step to make sure I get it right.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n1 (from 828,521) - 9 (from 800,059).

How many flowers are there in all?\"\n\nOkay, so I need to find the total number of flowers in all the pots. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know there are 141 pots. Each pot contains 71 flowers. So, to find the total number of flowers, I should multiply the number of pots by the number of flowers per pot.\n\nSo, that would be 141 pots times 71 flowers per pot.\n\nNow, I need to do the multiplication. Let's see, 141 multiplied by 71.\n\nI remember that multiplication can be a bit tricky with larger numbers, so I should be careful here.\n\nOne way to do this is to multiply 141 by 70 and then add another 141, since 71 is 70 plus 1.\n\nSo, first, 141 times 70.\n\n141 times 7 is 987, and since it's 70, I need to add a zero at the end, making it 9,870.\n\nThen, I add another 141 to that, because of the +1 in 71.\n\nSo, 9,870 plus 141 is 10,011.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 9,870 plus 141.\n\n70 plus 141 is 211, and 9,000 plus 211 is 9,211. Wait, that doesn't seem right.\n\nHold on, I must have messed up the addition.\n\nLet's try that again. 9,870 plus 141.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n0 plus 1 is 1.\n\n70 plus 40 is 110, so write down 10 and carry over 1.\n\n9,800 plus 100 is 9,900, plus the carried over 1 is 9,901.\n\nWait, that still doesn't seem right. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can break it down using the distributive property.\n\n141 times 71 is the same as 141 times (70 + 1), which is (141 times 70) plus (141 times 1).\n\nWe already did 141 times 70 is 9,870, and 141 times 1 is 141.\n\nSo, 9,870 plus 141 should give us the total.\n\nLet's add those step by step.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n0 + 1 = 1.\n\nThen, the tens place: 70 + 40 = 110. Write down 10 and carry over 1.\n\nNow, the thousands place: 800 plus 100 is 900, plus the carried over 1 is 901.\n\nSo, it's 9,870 plus 141 equals 10,011.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that was incorrect, but now it seems to be 10,011.\n\nLet me verify this again.\n\n141 times 71.\n\nI can also multiply it directly:\n\n   141\n\ntimes 71\n\nFirst, multiply 141 by 1, which is 141.\n\nThen, multiply 141 by 70, which is 9,870.\n\nNow, add them together: 141 + 9,870 = 10,011.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the total number of flowers is 10,011.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check another way.\n\nI can also multiply 141 by 71 using the standard algorithm.\n\n   141\n\ntimes 71\n\nFirst, multiply 1 times 141, which is 141.\n\nThen, multiply 70 times 141, which is 9,870.\n\nNow, add them together: 141 + 9,870 = 10,011.\n\nSame result.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for multiplication:\n\n(100 + 40 + 1) times (70 + 1).\n\nBut that might be more complicated for this situation.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the total number of flowers is 1", "answer": 10011, "equiv": false}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "23", "answer": 23, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1862", "answer": 1862, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, initially, there were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Then, Jessica cut some more flowers from her garden and added them to the vase. After that, there are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. The question is, how many orchids did she cut from her garden?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many orchids were added. Initially, there were 3 orchids, and now there are 7. So, the number of orchids added is 7 minus 3, which is 4. So, Jessica must have cut 4 orchids, right?\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says she cut some more roses and orchids. So, she added both roses and orchids to the vase. But it's asking specifically for how many orchids she cut.\n\nHmm, but in my calculation, it seems straightforward: 7 orchids now minus the original 3 means she added 4 orchids. So, she must have cut 4 orchids from her garden.\n\nBut let's double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. The number of roses also changed. Initially, there were 16 roses, and now there are 13. That seems odd because the problem says she cut some more roses, but the number of roses in the vase decreased from 16 to 13. That doesn't make sense. If she cut more roses and added them to the vase, the number should increase, not decrease.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me look back.\n\n\"The vase initially had 16 roses and 3 orchids. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase.\"\n\nSo, starting with 16 roses and 3 orchids, she added some roses and some orchids, and ended up with 13 roses and 7 orchids.\n\nWait, that's strange. Adding flowers should increase the number in the vase, but the roses decreased from 16 to 13. Maybe the problem means that she removed some flowers instead of adding them.\n\nBut the problem says she \"cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden,\" which implies she added them to the vase.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"cutting\" means removing them from the vase.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If she cuts flowers from her garden, she's getting more flowers to add to the vase, not removing them.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. The numbers don't make sense if she's adding flowers.\n\nLet me consider another angle. Suppose she started with 16 roses and 3 orchids. She added some roses and some orchids, and ended up with 13 roses and 7 orchids.\n\nSo, for roses: 16 + (added roses) = 13. That would mean added roses = 13 - 16 = -3. That doesn't make sense, because you can't add a negative number of flowers. So, perhaps it's a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she added some flowers and some were removed or died or something. But that's not stated in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that there were originally 13 roses and 7 orchids, and she added some more to get to 16 roses and 3 orchids. But that doesn't match the wording.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let's try to rephrase the problem to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\n\"There were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase. How many orchids did she cut?\"\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe \"cutting\" flowers from the garden means removing them from the garden and adding them to the vase, thus increasing the number in the vase.\n\nBut in this case, the number of roses decreased from 16 to 13, which contradicts that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"cutting\" means removing them from the vase.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because she's cutting from the garden, not from the vase.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's try to think differently.\n\nSuppose that she started with 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. She added some number of roses and some number of orchids from her garden. After adding, she has 13 roses and 7 orchids in the vase.\n\nSo, the equations would be:\n\nRoses: 16 + (added roses) = 13\n\nOrchids: 3 + (added orchids) = 7\n\nFrom the orchids equation, added orchids = 7 - 3 = 4\n\nFrom the roses", "answer": 4, "equiv": false}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "84", "answer": 84, "equiv": true}, {"output": "104", "answer": 104, "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": 10, "equiv": true}, {"output": "17", "answer": 17, "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": 10, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Ed and Doug, and they have marbles. The problem says that Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug initially. Then, Doug lost 3 of his marbles at the playground. After that, Ed had 27 marbles. We need to find out how many marbles Doug had initially.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand the relationship between the number of marbles Ed and Doug had initially. If Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug, that means if Doug had, say, D marbles, then Ed had D + 5 marbles.\n\nWait, the problem says Ed had 27 marbles, and this is after Doug lost some marbles. But actually, the problem doesn't specify when Ed's marbles were counted. Let's read it again carefully: \"Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 3 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 27 marbles. How many marbles did Doug have initially?\"\n\nSo, Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug initially. Let's denote the initial number of marbles Doug had as D. Then, Ed had D + 5 marbles initially.\n\nAfter that, Doug lost 3 marbles at the playground. So, Doug's new number of marbles is D - 3.\n\nThe problem then says \"If Ed had 27 marbles.\" Hmm, it's a bit unclear whether this is before or after Doug lost his marbles. But looking at it, it seems like it's after Doug lost his marbles, because it's presented as a sequence: Doug loses marbles, then Ed has 27 marbles.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"If Ed had 27 marbles.\" It's a bit ambiguous. Let's consider two possibilities:\n\n1. Ed had 27 marbles before Doug lost any marbles.\n\n2. Ed had 27 marbles after Doug lost 3 marbles.\n\nLet's think about which one makes more sense. If Ed's number of marbles is being compared to Doug's initial number, and Doug loses some marbles later, it's probably that Ed's count is after Doug's loss.\n\nBut actually, the problem says \"Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug.\" This is likely referring to their initial counts before any marbles were lost. Then, Doug loses 3 marbles, and somehow Ed has 27 marbles at some point.\n\nWait, maybe I should assign variables and write equations based on the information given.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nD = initial number of marbles Doug had.\n\nThen, Ed initially had D + 5 marbles.\n\nAfter Doug loses 3 marbles, Doug has D - 3 marbles.\n\nThe problem then says \"If Ed had 27 marbles.\" It's a bit unclear whether this is his initial count or after Doug lost marbles. But since the loss is Doug's, it's probably referring to Ed's count after Doug's loss.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"If Ed had 27 marbles\" is a given condition, and we need to find Doug's initial marbles based on that.\n\nLet me try to set up an equation.\n\nWe have:\n\nEd's initial marbles: D + 5\n\nDoug's marbles after losing 3: D - 3\n\nEd's marbles are 27, but is this before or after Doug's loss?\n\nWait, perhaps the timing of Ed's count is independent of Doug's loss. Maybe Ed's marbles didn't change at all.\n\nSo, if Ed had 27 marbles, and he had 5 more than Doug initially, then Doug initially had 27 - 5 = 22 marbles.\n\nBut then, Doug lost 3 marbles, so he would have 22 - 3 = 19 marbles after the loss.\n\nBut the problem doesn't ask for Doug's marbles after the loss; it asks for his initial number.\n\nSo, according to this, Doug initially had 22 marbles.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let's see:\n\nEd had 5 more marbles than Doug initially.\n\nSo, Ed's initial marbles = Doug's initial marbles + 5.\n\nThen, Doug lost 3 marbles, so Doug's marbles became D - 3.\n\nBut the problem says \"If Ed had 27 marbles.\" It's a bit unclear whether this is Ed's initial count or his count after Doug lost marbles.\n\nPerhaps it's Ed's count after Doug lost marbles, but that doesn't make much sense because Ed's marbles weren't involved in the loss.\n\nMaybe it's better to assume that Ed's marbles didn't change, and \"If Ed had 27 marbles\" refers to his initial count.\n\nSo, if Ed had 27 marbles initially, and he had", "answer": 22, "equiv": false}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "25", "answer": 25, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "33", "answer": 33, "equiv": true}, {"output": "12", "answer": 12, "equiv": true}, {"output": "118", "answer": 118, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": 7, "equiv": true}, {"output": "192", "answer": 192, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Mary is baking a cake, and the recipe calls for specific amounts of sugar and flour. According to the recipe, she needs 6 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. But it seems like she's already added some ingredients, and I need to figure out how much more flour she needs to add.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what she has already put into the mixture. The problem says she already put in 7 cups of flour and 60 cups of sugar. Hmm, 60 cups of sugar? That seems like a lot\u2014way more than the recipe calls for, which is only 6 cups. Maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be 6 cups of sugar already added, not 60. But I'll stick to the numbers given unless I'm sure it's a mistake.\n\nSo, the recipe requires:\n\n- Sugar: 6 cups\n\n- Flour: 14 cups\n\nMary has already added:\n\n- Flour: 7 cups\n\n- Sugar: 60 cups\n\nThe problem is asking how many more cups of flour she needs to add. So, I need to find the difference between the required flour and the flour already added.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much flour she still needs to add:\n\nFlour needed = Required flour - Flour already added\n\nFlour needed = 14 cups - 7 cups = 7 cups\n\nSo, she needs to add 7 more cups of flour.\n\nBut wait a minute, the sugar seems off. She's supposed to add 6 cups, but she already added 60 cups. That's 10 times the required amount! Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be 6 cups instead of 60. But since the problem specifies 60, I'll assume that's correct.\n\nHowever, since the question is only asking for the flour, I don't need to worry about the sugar right now. But perhaps there's more to this problem.\n\nLet me double-check the question: \"How many more cups of flour does she need to add?\" Okay, so it's solely about the flour.\n\nGiven that, my calculation stands: she needs to add 7 more cups of flour.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here. Maybe the excessive sugar affects the flour amount or something. In regular baking, ingredients are proportional, but according to the recipe, she's already added way more sugar than needed.\n\nPerhaps the recipe's proportions are important. Let's see.\n\nThe recipe's ratio of sugar to flour is 6:14, which simplifies to 3:7.\n\nNow, with 60 cups of sugar already added and 7 cups of flour, let's see the current ratio.\n\nCurrent sugar to flour ratio is 60:7.\n\nComparing this to the desired 3:7 ratio.\n\nDoes this need to be maintained?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about maintaining the ratio, and I need to calculate the flour based on the excessive sugar added.\n\nLet me explore this.\n\nIf the recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour, that's a ratio of sugar to flour of 6:14, which simplifies to 3:7.\n\nSo, for every 3 parts of sugar, she needs 7 parts of flour.\n\nShe has added 60 cups of sugar, which is 10 times the recipe's 6 cups (since 6*10=60).\n\nSo, to maintain the ratio, she should add 10 times the flour required by the recipe.\n\n14 cups * 10 = 140 cups of flour.\n\nBut she has already added 7 cups of flour.\n\nTherefore, the additional flour needed is 140 - 7 = 133 cups.\n\nThis seems like a significant amount, but if she added 10 times the sugar, she'd need 10 times the flour to keep the proportions the same.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the flour needed was just 7 cups to meet the recipe's requirement, but that was without considering the excessive sugar.\n\nI think maintaining the ratio is important in baking, so perhaps that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem doesn't care about the ratio and just wants to know how much more flour is needed to meet the recipe's requirement, ignoring the excessive sugar.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense, because if she's already added 60 cups of sugar, which is way more than required, perhaps she needs to adjust the flour accordingly.\n\nI think considering the ratio is the way to go.\n\nSo, the ratio of sugar to flour should be 3:7.\n\nShe has 60 cups of sugar, so the amount of flour needed is (7/3)*60 = 140 cups.\n\nShe has already added 7 cups, so she needs", "answer": 7, "equiv": false}, {"output": "9", "answer": 9, "equiv": true}, {"output": "34", "answer": 34, "equiv": true}, {"output": "60", "answer": 60, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

Maybe it means I read some books multiple times, or perhaps there are more books in the series than mentioned. But according to the problem, there are 10 different books and 11 different movies in the series.\n\nMaybe the problem is trying to say that there are 10 different books and 11 different movies, but I have read 13 books and watched 12 movies, some of which might be from other series. But the problem specifies \"in the crazy silly school series,\" so perhaps I read 13 books in total, some of which are from this series, and watched 12 movies, again, some from this series.\n\nBut that seems unclear. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are supposed to be different. Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be 10 books, 11 movies, read 10 books, watched 11 movies. But that wouldn't make sense because the question is asking for how many more books than movies I read, and in that case, it would be zero.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are supposed to be 10 books, 11 movies, read 11 books, watched 12 movies. But again, that doesn't align with the given numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to say that there are 10 different books and 11 different movies, but I read 13 different books and watched 12 different movies from another series. But that doesn't make sense either.\n\nI think I need to just proceed with the numbers as given, assuming that I read 13 books and watched 12 movies, regardless of the total available in the series.\n\nSo, to find how many more books than movies I read, I subtract the number of movies watched from the number of books read:\n\n13 (books read) - 12 (movies watched) = 1\n\nSo, I read 1 more book than movies.\n\nBut this seems too straightforward, and perhaps I'm missing something in the problem.

Then, he picked 172 potatoes. I need to find out how many tomatoes and potatoes he has left after picking those potatoes.\n\nSo, let's think about the tomatoes first. The problem says he had 175 tomatoes, and it doesn't mention that he picked any tomatoes, only that he picked potatoes. So, the number of tomatoes should stay the same, right? He didn't pick any tomatoes, so he still has all 175 of them.\n\nNow, for the potatoes. He had 77 potatoes to start with, and he picked 172 potatoes. Wait a minute, that seems a bit off. He had 77 potatoes, but he picked 172? That can't be right. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Or perhaps he had more potatoes than mentioned.\n\nLet me check the problem again. \"A farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he picked 172 potatoes.\" Hmm, it says he had 77 potatoes but picked 172. That would mean he picked more potatoes than he had, which isn't possible unless he somehow got more potatoes from somewhere else, but the problem doesn't mention that.\n\nMaybe it's a typo, and it should be that he had 177 potatoes, for example, and picked 172. That would make more sense. Or perhaps it's the other way around, and he had 175 tomatoes and 177 potatoes, but the problem clearly says 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes.\n\nWait, maybe I misread it. Let's look again: \"A farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he picked 172 potatoes.\" Yes, that's what it says.\n\nWell, in reality, he can't pick more potatoes than he has, so perhaps this is a trick question or there's some other interpretation. Maybe he had 77 potatoes and picked 172, which means he picked all 77 and still needs 95 more, but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant to say he had 175 tomatoes and 177 potatoes, and he picked 172 potatoes. That would make sense, but again, the problem clearly states 77 potatoes.\n\nPerhaps it's a mistake in the problem, and the teacher or whoever provided it meant different numbers. In that case, maybe I should assume that he had 175 tomatoes and 177 potatoes, and he picked 172 potatoes.\n\nBut to play it safe, I'll consider the problem as it's written and see what answer I get.\n\nSo, tomatoes: 175, no change since he didn't pick any.\n\nPotatoes: 77 initially, picked 172. So, 77 - 172 = ?\n\nWell, 77 minus 172 is like 77 - 172 = -95. So, he would have -95 potatoes left, which doesn't make sense in reality because you can't have negative potatoes.\n\nMaybe the problem is trying to teach about negative numbers, but that seems unlikely at this level.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to be interpreted as him having 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes, and he picked 172 potatoes, but since he doesn't have that many potatoes, he can only pick the 77 he has, and maybe owes or something for the rest.\n\nBut that seems too complicated for a basic math problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo, and it should be that he picked 72 potatoes instead of 172, which would make more sense.\n\nLet me try that: if he had 77 potatoes and picked 72, then 77 - 72 = 5 potatoes left.\n\nPlus the 175 tomatoes, so total left would be 175 tomatoes and 5 potatoes.\n\nBut the problem says 172, not 72.\n\nWait, maybe it's a misprint, and it's supposed to be 72 instead of 172.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are correct, and it's a trick question to see if you notice that he can't pick more potatoes than he has.\n\nIn that case, maybe the answer is that he has 175 tomatoes and 0 potatoes left, since he can", "answer": 80, "equiv": false}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "180", "answer": 180, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many cakes each of Matthew's friends ate.

The question is, how many cakes did each person eat?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. Matthew has 4 friends, and he gave away crackers and cakes equally among them. So, each friend got the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes.\n\nBut wait, the problem says he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his friends. Does that mean each friend got the same number of crackers and cakes, or that the total number of crackers and cakes given to each friend was equal?\n\nHmm. Let's look at the wording again: \"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends.\"\n\nThis seems to suggest that each friend received the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the number of crackers each friend got should be equal to the number of cakes each friend got.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because he had different total numbers of crackers and cakes. He had 10 crackers and 8 cakes.\n\nIf he gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each friend, but he has different totals, there must be some restriction here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it means that he distributed the crackers and cakes equally among his friends, and somehow the numbers worked out to be equal per friend.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider that Matthew distributed all his crackers and all his cakes equally among his 4 friends.\n\nSo, the number of crackers each friend got is 10 divided by 4, but 10 divided by 4 is 2.5. Wait, but you can't really give half a cracker in some contexts, but mathematically, it's possible.\n\nSimilarly, the number of cakes each friend got is 8 divided by 4, which is 2.\n\nBut the problem says he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his friends. So, if each friend got 2 cakes, and 2.5 crackers, that wouldn't be equal numbers.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"equal numbers of crackers and cakes.\" So, perhaps he gave each friend the same number of crackers and cakes, but in a whole number.\n\nBut 10 crackers divided by 4 is 2.5, which isn't a whole number. Maybe the problem assumes that only whole items are distributed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Matthew didn't distribute all of the crackers and cakes, but only a portion that can be divided equally.\n\nBut that seems complicated. Maybe I'm overthinking this.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of crackers each friend got as C and the number of cakes as K.\n\nAccording to the problem, C = K, because he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend.\n\nAlso, total crackers given away are 4C (since there are 4 friends), and total cakes given away are 4K.\n\nBut since C = K, the total given away is 4C crackers and 4K cakes.\n\nBut he had 10 crackers and 8 cakes initially.\n\nSo, 4C \u2264 10 and 4K \u2264 8.\n\nBut since C = K, we can set 4C \u2264 10 and 4C \u2264 8.\n\nThe more restrictive condition is 4C \u2264 8, which means C \u2264 2.\n\nSo, each friend got at most 2 crackers and 2 cakes.\n\nBut does that answer the question?\n\nWait, the question is, how many cakes did each person eat?\n\nAssuming that \"eat\" means \"receive\" in this context, then each friend ate 2 cakes.\n\nBut let me check if that makes sense.\n\nIf each friend got 2 cakes, then 4 friends would get a total of 8 cakes, which matches the initial number of cakes.\n\nSimilarly, if each friend got 2 crackers, then 4 friends would get a total of 8 crackers, but Matthew had 10 crackers.\n\nSo, he would have 2 crackers left over.\n\nBut the problem says he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his friends, and he had 10 crackers and 8 cakes initially.\n\nSo, giving each friend 2 crackers and 2 cakes would use up all the cakes and leave 2 crackers unused.\n\nAlternatively, if he gave each friend 2.5 crackers and 2.5 cakes, that would use up 10 crackers and 10 cakes, but he only has 8 cakes.\n\nThat doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe he gave each friend 2 crackers and 2 cakes, and had 2 crackers left over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he gave each friend a different number.\n\nBut the problem specifies equal numbers, so perhaps it", "answer": 2, "equiv": false}, {"output": "16", "answer": 16, "equiv": true}, {"output": "15", "answer": 15, "equiv": true}, {"output": "125", "answer": 125, "equiv": true}, {"output": "30", "answer": 30, "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": 6, "equiv": true}, {"output": "137", "answer": 137, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1124", "answer": 1124, "equiv": true}, {"output": "81", "answer": 81, "equiv": true}, {"output": "469", "answer": 469, "equiv": true}, {"output": "72", "answer": 72, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "12", "answer": 12, "equiv": true}, {"output": "174080", "answer": 174080, "equiv": true}, {"output": "450", "answer": 450, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Marco and his dad who went strawberry picking. Together, their strawberries weighed 4 pounds, and Marco's strawberries alone weighed 19 pounds. We need to find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed compared to his dad's.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much his dad's strawberries weighed. We know that together they picked 4 pounds, and Marco picked 19 pounds. Wait, that doesn't seem right. If Marco picked 19 pounds and together they picked 4 pounds, that would mean his dad picked a negative amount, which is impossible.\n\nMaybe I misread the problem. Let me look back. \"Together their strawberries weighed 4 pounds. Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds.\" That can't be right because if Marco alone picked 19 pounds, how can together they only have 4 pounds? It must be a typo in the problem.\n\nPerhaps it's supposed to be that Marco and his dad together picked 19 pounds, and Marco picked 4 pounds, and we need to find out how much his dad picked and then how much more Marco picked than his dad. But that doesn't match the problem statement.\n\nWait, maybe the total is 19 pounds and Marco picked 4 pounds, so his dad picked 15 pounds, and then Marco's strawberries weigh 4 pounds, which is less than his dad's 15 pounds. But the problem says \"how much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?\", which would be negative in this case, meaning his dad's are heavier.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense with the way the problem is worded. It says \"how much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?\", implying that Marco's are heavier, but in this case, his dad's are heavier.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the problem's numbers. Maybe it's supposed to be that together they picked 23 pounds (4 + 19), or perhaps the total is 19 pounds and Marco picked 4 pounds.\n\nLet me assume that the total weight is 19 pounds and Marco picked 4 pounds. Then his dad picked 19 - 4 = 15 pounds. So, his dad picked 15 pounds and Marco picked 4 pounds. Therefore, his dad's strawberries weigh 15 - 4 = 11 pounds more than Marco's.\n\nBut that's not what the problem is asking. The problem says \"how much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?\", which in this case would be negative 11 pounds, but we typically say how much more one thing weighs than another without negative values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total is 4 pounds and Marco picked some amount, but that doesn't make sense because you can't pick a negative amount.\n\nI think the problem might have a typo. Perhaps it's supposed to be that together they picked 23 pounds, and Marco picked 19 pounds, then his dad picked 4 pounds, and Marco's strawberries are 19 - 4 = 15 pounds more than his dad's.\n\nThat seems plausible. Let me try that.\n\nIf together they picked 19 + 4 = 23 pounds, and Marco picked 19 pounds, then his dad picked 4 pounds. So, Marco's strawberries are 19 - 4 = 15 pounds more than his dad's.\n\nBut the problem says \"together their strawberries weighed 4 pounds, Marco's strawberries weighed 19 pounds.\" That would imply his dad picked 4 - 19 = -15 pounds, which is impossible.\n\nSo, I'm going to assume it's a typo, and the total is 19 pounds, Marco picked 4 pounds, dad picked 15 pounds, and Marco's strawberries are 15 pounds less than his dad's.\n\nBut the problem asks \"how much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad's?\", which in this case would be negative 11 pounds, but we don't express it that way. We might say his dad's strawberries weighed 11 pounds more than Marco's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is meant to be that together they picked 19 pounds, and Marco picked 4 pounds more than his dad. In that case, let's set up equations.\n\nLet dad's strawberries be x pounds. Then Marco's are x + 4 pounds. Together, x + (x + 4) = 19 pounds.\n\nSo, 2x + 4 = 19\n\nSubtract 4: 2x = 15\n\nDivide by 2: x = 7.5 pounds\n\nSo, dad picked 7.5 pounds, Marco picked 7.5 + 4 = 11.5 pounds.\n\nThen, Marco's strawberries weigh 11.5 - 7.5 = 4 pounds more than his", "answer": 34, "equiv": false}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "98", "answer": 98, "equiv": true}, {"output": "21", "answer": 21, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: Faye is placing her pencils and crayons into 11 rows, with 31 pencils and 27 crayons in each row.

Since there are 31 pencils in each row and there are 11 rows, I can multiply 31 by 11 to get the total number of pencils.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 31 times 11.\n\nWell, 31 times 10 is 310, and then I need to add another 31 for the remaining 1 in 11. So 310 plus 31 is 341. So, there are 341 pencils in total.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many crayons there are. There are 27 crayons in each row, and again, there are 11 rows. So, I'll multiply 27 by 11 to get the total number of crayons.\n\n27 times 11. Similarly, 27 times 10 is 270, and then plus another 27 for the last 1, which makes 270 plus 27 equals 297.

Then 41 plus 97. 41 plus 90 is 131, and then plus 7 more is 138. So, 500 plus 138 is 638.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that addition again.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 341 plus 300 would be 641, but since it's only 297, which is 3 less than 300, I need to subtract 3 from 641, which gives me 638.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, altogether, Faye has 638 pencils and crayons.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should verify these calculations once more.\n\nFirst, pencils: 31 per row, 11 rows. 31 times 11 is indeed 341.\n\nCrayons: 27 per row, 11 rows. 27 times 11 is indeed 297.\n\nAdding 341 and 297 should give me the total.\n\nLet me add them again: 341 plus 297.\n\nBreaking it down, 300 plus 200 is 500, 41 plus 97 is 138, and 500 plus 138 is 638.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the total number of items per row and then multiply by the number of rows.\n\nEach row has 31 pencils and 27 crayons, so total items per row are 31 plus 27.\n\nLet's calculate that: 31 plus 27 is 58 items per row.\n\nThen, for 11 rows, it would be 58 times 11.\n\nLet me calculate that: 58 times 10 is 580, plus another 58 for the remaining 1, which is 580 plus 58 equals 638.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier total.\n\nThis gives me more confidence that 638 is the correct total number of pencils and crayons altogether.\n\nJust to be extra sure, perhaps I can try another method.\n\nI could multiply the number of rows by the number of pencils and crayons separately and then add them up, which is what I did first, or multiply the total items per row by the number of rows, which is what I did second.\n\nBoth methods gave me the same answer, so I think it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total number of items is equal to the sum of all pencils and all crayons.\n\nWhich is (31 pencils/row * 11 rows) + (27 crayons/row * 11 rows).\n\nThis is the same as 31*11 + 27*11.\n\nI can factor out the 11: ", "answer": 638, "equiv": false}, {"output": "2523", "answer": 29, "equiv": false}, {"output": "So Emily is making bead necklaces for her friends.

If Emily had 2 beads and made 32 necklaces, it sounds like she used very few beads per necklace. But let's think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a total number of beads, which is 2, and a total number of necklaces, which is 32. We need to find out how many beads each necklace required.\n\nThis sounds like a division problem. If she used a certain number of beads for each necklace, then the total number of beads divided by the number of necklaces should give us the beads per necklace.\n\nSo, beads per necklace = total beads / number of necklaces\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nBeads per necklace = 2 / 32\n\nWait a minute, that would give us 2 divided by 32, which is 0.0625.

Let me read it again.\n\n\"Emily is making bead necklaces for her friends. She had 2 beads and she was able to make 32 necklaces.

But it says \"she had 2 beads,\" which makes me think it's 2 beads in total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo, and she had more beads. But according to the problem, it's 2 beads.\n\nLet me consider if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe \"she had 2 beads\" refers to 2 different types of beads, and she used multiple beads of each type in the necklaces. But that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's 2 beads per some unit, but that doesn't make sense here.\n\nWait, maybe it's a misinterpretation of the units. Perhaps she had 2 bags of beads, and each bag contains a certain number of beads, and she made 32 necklaces from those 2 bags.\n\nBut the problem says \"she had 2 beads,\" which seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a misprint, and it should be \"20 beads\" or something like that. But based on what's written, it's 2 beads.\n\nGiven that, perhaps some necklaces share beads, but that seems unusual.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some necklaces have multiple beads, and some have fewer, but the problem seems to suggest that each necklace needed the same number of beads.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to approach it differently.\n\nIf she made 32 necklaces with 2 beads in total, then on average, each necklace would get 2/32 = 1/16 of a bead. But again, that doesn't make sense practically.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she used both beads in each necklace, but that would mean each necklace has 2 beads, and she would only be able to make 1 necklace, since she only has 2 beads. But the problem says she made 32 necklaces.\n\nThis is perplexing. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"she had 2 beads\" means she had 2 beads to start with, and she bought more to make the necklaces. But the problem doesn't mention that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"2 beads\" are leftover after making the necklaces.\n\nBut the problem says \"she had 2 beads and she was able to make 32 necklaces.\"\n\nWait, maybe it's 2 beads per necklace, but that wouldn't make sense because then she would need 64 beads in total, which contradicts \"she had 2 beads.\"\n\nI'm stuck in a loop here.\n\nLet me consider if there's a different interpretation of \"she had 2 beads.\"\n\nPerhaps \"she had 2 types of beads,\" and she used a combination of these beads in each necklace.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify different types of beads.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a trick question, and the answer is that it's impossible to make 32 necklaces with only 2 beads.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she used fractional beads, but again, that doesn't make much sense in reality.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she had 2 beads initially and then received more beads to make the necklaces, but the problem doesn't provide that information.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about determining how many beads each necklace needs if she had 2 beads and made 32 necklaces.\n\nMaybe it's assuming that the beads were used in a specific pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a rate problem, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe", "answer": 16, "equiv": false}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "13", "answer": 13, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "37", "answer": 37, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "95", "answer": 95, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "21", "answer": 21, "equiv": true}, {"output": "58", "answer": 58, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here.

It wants the total number of kids in Lawrence County. From the information given, I know how many kids stayed home and how many went to camp from Lawrence County. There's also this extra bit about 78 kids from outside the county who attended the camp.\n\nSo, I think the total number of kids in Lawrence County would be the sum of those who stayed home and those who went to camp, right?

Do I need to include them in the total for Lawrence County? No, because they're from outside the county.

Maybe it's a hypothetical scenario or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should interpret it differently.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nLet's define the variables:\n\nLet J represent the number of peaches Jill has.\n\nThen, Steven has J + 8 peaches.\n\nAnd Jake has (J + 8) - 3 = J + 5 peaches.\n\nBut the problem states that Steven has 5 peaches, so J + 8 = 5.\n\nSolving for J, J = 5 - 8 = -3.\n\nAgain, I get that Jill has -3 peaches, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, and Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, and Steven has 5 peaches.\n\nSo, Steven: 5 peaches.\n\nJill: Steven's peaches - 8 = 5 - 8 = -3 peaches.\n\nJake: Steven's peaches - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2 peaches.\n\nThen, the question is how many more peaches Jake has than Jill: 2 - (-3) = 5.\n\nSo, Jake has 5 more peaches than Jill.\n\nBut again, the negative number of peaches for Jill seems odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and it should say that Steven has 8 peaches instead of 5, so that Jill would have a positive number of peaches.\n\nBut assuming the problem is correct as stated, then Jill has -3 peaches, which we can perhaps interpret as owing 3 peaches or something like that, but in standard terms, it's not possible.\n\nHowever, following the problem as given, the answer would be that Jake has 5 more peaches than Jill.\n\nBut I'm still uneasy about the negative number of peaches.

So, we have three people here: Steven, Jake, and Jill, and they all have some peaches. The problem gives us a few relationships between the number of peaches each one has, and we need to find out how many peaches Jake has.\n\nFirst, it says that Steven has 12 peaches. That's straightforward. So, Steven's peaches are 12.\n\nNext, it mentions that Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven. So, if Steven has 12, then Jake has 12 minus 4. That would be 8 peaches. But wait, the problem isn't over yet, and it seems there's more to consider here.\n\nThe problem also says that Steven has 67 more peaches than Jill. So, if Jill has some number of peaches, let's call it J, then Steven has J + 67 peaches. But we already know that Steven has 12 peaches. So, we can set up the equation: J + 67 = 12.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't make sense because if J + 67 = 12, then J would be 12 - 67, which is negative 55.

That doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps the way the problem is worded is a bit confusing. Let's try to break it down differently.\n\nThe phrase \"Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven who has 67 more peaches than Jill\" can be parsed as:\n\n- Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven.\n\n- Steven has 67 more peaches than Jill.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nSteven's peaches: 12\n\nJake's peaches: Steven's peaches - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8\n\nAnd Steven's peaches = Jill's peaches + 67.\n\nSo, Jill's peaches = Steven's peaches - 67 = 12 - 67 = -55.\n\nAgain, we get a negative number for Jill's peaches, which doesn't make sense in this context. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem itself, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nLet me consider the sentence structure again: \"Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven who has 67 more peaches than Jill.\"\n\nThis seems to be a compound sentence. It's saying two things:\n\n1. Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven.\n\n2. Steven has 67 more peaches than Jill.\n\nSo, based on this, the relationships are:\n\nJake = Steven - 4\n\nSteven = Jill + 67\n\nWe know Steven = 12.\n\nSo, Jill = Steven - 67 = 12 - 67 = -55.\n\nThis suggests that Jill has -55 peaches, which is impossible.\n\nMaybe the problem is trying to say something else. Perhaps it's a trick question, and negative peaches are allowed for some reason. But in general, peaches can't be negative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the relationships are nested differently. Let's try to rephrase the problem.\n\nIf Steven has 12 peaches and he has 67 more than Jill, then Jill has 12 - 67 = -55 peaches. Then Jake has 4 fewer than Steven, so Jake has 12 - 4 = 8 peaches.\n\nBut the negative peaches for Jill don't make sense. Maybe the problem is trying to say that Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, who himself has 67 more peaches than Jill. So, perhaps the relationships are:\n\nSteven = Jill + 67\n\nJake = Steven - 4\n\nBut with Steven = 12, Jill would be -55, which is problematic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a mistake, and Steven actually has fewer peaches than Jill. But the problem says Steven has 67 more than Jill, which points to Steven having more.\n\nWait a second, maybe the problem is misphrased, and it's supposed to be that Steven has 67 fewer peaches than someone else.

So, Debby bought two types of bottles: soda and water. She bought 360 soda bottles and 162 water bottles. Now, she drinks both types every day: 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a day. The question is asking how many days the soda bottles would last.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on the soda bottles because that's what the question is about. Debby has 360 soda bottles, and she drinks 9 of them each day. To find out how many days the soda bottles will last, I should divide the total number of soda bottles by the number she drinks per day.\n\nSo, that's 360 soda bottles divided by 9 soda bottles per day. Let me do that calculation:\n\n360 \u00f7 9 = 40\n\nSo, the soda bottles would last for 40 days.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem also mentions water bottles. She has 162 water bottles and drinks 122 a day. Does that affect the soda bottles?\n\nHmm, let's see. The question is specifically asking for how many days the soda bottles would last, given her daily consumption of both soda and water bottles. But since she drinks both separately, and the soda consumption is independent of the water consumption, I think I can just focus on the soda bottles.\n\nLet me double-check. If she drinks 9 soda bottles every day, and she has 360 of them, then indeed, 360 divided by 9 is 40 days. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider if there's a possibility that she might run out of water bottles before the soda bottles are finished. Would that affect anything?\n\nWell, the problem says she drank 122 water bottles a day, and she has 162 water bottles. So, let's see how many days the water bottles would last.\n\n162 water bottles \u00f7 122 water bottles per day.\n\nWait, 122 per day? That seems like a lot. Is that even possible? Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be 12 water bottles per day instead of 122. Let me check the original problem.\n\nDebby bought 360 soda bottles and 162 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a day. How many days would the soda bottles last?\n\nOkay, it does say 122 water bottles per day. That does seem like an unusually high number, but maybe it's a big family or something. But since the question is only about the soda bottles, I think I can ignore the water bottles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intent is to see if the water bottles run out before the soda bottles, and if so, the soda bottles would last longer than the calculated 40 days because she would stop drinking them when the water runs out.\n\nLet me calculate how many days the water bottles would last.\n\n162 water bottles \u00f7 122 water bottles per day.\n\n122 times 1 is 122, which is less than 162. 122 times 1 is 122, so 162 minus 122 is 40. So, she can drink for 1 day fully, and on the second day, she would run out after drinking 40 bottles.\n\nSo, approximately 1.31 days. But that doesn't make sense because she can't drink a fraction of a day in this context. Maybe it's per week or something, but the problem says \"per day.\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's a typo, and it's supposed to be 12 water bottles per day instead of 122. That would make more sense.\n\nLet me assume it's a typo and proceed with 12 water bottles per day.\n\nSo, 162 water bottles \u00f7 12 water bottles per day = 13.5 days.\n\nSo, the water bottles would last for 13.5 days, and the soda bottles would last for 40 days. Since the water bottles run out first, perhaps the soda bottles would only be consumed for 13.5 days, and then she would stop drinking soda because there's no water left.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any relationship between drinking soda and water. It just says she drinks both separately. So, perhaps the soda bottles would still last for 40 days, regardless of the water bottles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the intent is that she drinks both together, and once one runs out, the other can't be consumed. But that's not specified.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll stick with the initial approach: calculate how long the soda bottles last based on her daily consumption of soda bottles.\n\nSo, 3", "answer": 40, "equiv": false}, {"output": "83", "answer": 83, "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": 6, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this problem here: Frank was reading his favorite book. He read 22 pages per day and it took him 569 days to finish the book. I need to find out how many pages are there in the book.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Frank reads 22 pages every day, and he kept doing this for 569 days to complete the book. So, to find the total number of pages, I think I need to multiply the number of pages he reads each day by the number of days he read.\n\nSo, it's like, pages per day times the number of days, which should give me the total pages. Let me write that down:\n\nTotal pages = pages per day \u00d7 number of days\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal pages = 22 pages/day \u00d7 569 days\n\nNow, I need to calculate 22 multiplied by 569. I'm a bit rusty on multiplying larger numbers, but I can break it down into smaller parts to make it easier.\n\nLet me see, 22 times 569.

How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\"\n\nAlright, so initially, there were 45 bird families living near the mountain. Out of these, 86 flew away for the winter. Wait, that seems a bit off. If there were only 45 bird families initially, how can 86 fly away? That doesn't make sense because you can't have more families flying away than there were present initially.\n\nMaybe I misread the problem. Let me look at it again.\n\n\"86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain. If there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially. How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\"\n\nOkay, so 86 bird families flew away, and initially, there were 45 bird families living near the mountain. Hmm, this is confusing. If there were only 45 bird families initially, but 86 flew away, it seems like there's a mistake in the problem. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be 45 flew away from 86 initially present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 86 bird families that flew away include not only those from near the mountain but also from other areas. But the problem says \"from near a mountain,\" so maybe it's just 86 families flew away from that specific area, and initially, there were only 45 families there.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the number of bird families that flew away is 86, and initially, there were 45 near the mountain. So, perhaps some bird families from other areas also joined them in flying away.\n\nBut the problem seems to suggest that all the bird families that flew away were from near the mountain, but that can't be if there were only 45 initially.\n\nMaybe I should just proceed with the numbers given and see what answer I get.\n\nSo, initially, there were 45 bird families near the mountain. 86 bird families flew away for the winter from that area. That means the number of bird families that stayed behind is the initial number minus those that flew away.\n\nStaying behind: 45 - 86 = -41.\n\nWait, a negative number of families doesn't make sense. This confirms that there's something wrong with the problem as stated.\n\nPerhaps it's a trick question or there's additional information I'm missing.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe the 86 bird families that flew away include not only those from near the mountain but also from other areas. So, the number that stayed behind is just the initial 45 minus the number that flew away from that area.\n\nBut the problem says \"from near a mountain,\" so it might be that only the bird families from near the mountain flew away, which is 45, but the problem says 86 flew away.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look at what's being asked: \"How many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind?\"\n\nSo, if F is the number that flew away, and S is the number that stayed behind, then the question is asking for F - S.\n\nGiven that F = 86, and S = initial - F, which is 45 - 86 = -41.\n\nThen, F - S = 86 - (-41) = 86 + 41 = 127.\n\nBut again, having a negative number of families doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that there were 45 bird families near the mountain, and 86 bird families flew away in total from various areas, and I need to find how many more flew away than stayed near the mountain.\n\nBut that still doesn't clarify the relationship.\n\nMaybe it's better to consider that the number of bird families that stayed behind is zero, and the rest flew away, but that doesn't add up either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is stating that 86 bird families flew away from near the mountain, but there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially, and some of them flew away, and some stayed.\n\nBut if 86 flew away and only 45 were there initially, that doesn't compute.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the problem itself. Maybe it's supposed to be 45 bird families flew away from near the mountain, and initially, there were 86 near the mountain.\n\nIn that case, the number that stayed behind would be 86 - 45 = 41.\n\nThen, the difference", "answer": 127, "equiv": false}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "460", "answer": 460, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this homework problem step by step. So, the problem says that Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework, 7 pages of reading homework, and 3 more pages of biology homework. And it's asking for the total number of pages of math and biology homework that she had to complete.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what's being asked. It's specifically asking for the pages of math and biology homework, not reading. So, I should ignore the reading homework pages for this calculation.\n\nRachel has 8 pages of math homework and some biology homework. The biology homework is 3 more pages than what? Hmm, it says \"3 more pages of biology homework,\" but it doesn't specify what it's 3 more pages than. Maybe it's 3 more pages compared to the reading homework?\n\nWait, the reading homework is 7 pages. If biology is 3 more pages than reading, then biology would be 7 + 3 = 10 pages.\n\nSo, math is 8 pages, and biology is 10 pages. To find the total of math and biology, I just need to add those two together: 8 + 10 = 18 pages.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if I interpreted the biology homework correctly. The problem says \"3 more pages of biology homework.\" It doesn't say \"3 more pages than reading,\" but if it's just stating that she has an additional 3 pages for biology, beyond what she has for reading, then my previous interpretation might be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"3 more pages of biology homework\" means that biology is 3 pages, in addition to the math and reading homework. But that doesn't make sense because then biology would be just 3 pages, and adding that to math would be 8 + 3 = 11 pages, but that seems inconsistent with the first part.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework, 7 pages of reading homework, and 3 more pages of biology homework.. How many pages of math and biology homework did she have to complete?\"\n\nI think the problem is that the biology homework is 3 more pages than the reading homework. Since reading is 7 pages, biology is 7 + 3 = 10 pages. Then, math is 8 pages. So, math and biology together are 8 + 10 = 18 pages.\n\nAlternatively, if \"3 more pages of biology homework\" means biology is 3 pages, then math and biology would be 8 + 3 = 11 pages, but that seems too low, especially since reading is 7 pages, and biology is only 3 pages, which might not make sense in context.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that maybe the biology homework is 3 pages more than the math homework. If math is 8 pages, then biology would be 8 + 3 = 11 pages. Then, math and biology together would be 8 + 11 = 19 pages.\n\nBut the problem says \"3 more pages of biology homework,\" which isn't directly comparative to math or reading. It's a bit ambiguous.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll consider both interpretations:\n\n1. Biology is 3 more pages than reading: biology = 7 + 3 = 10 pages; math + biology = 8 + 10 = 18 pages.\n\n2. Biology is 3 more pages than math: biology = 8 + 3 = 11 pages; math + biology = 8 + 11 = 19 pages.\n\nI need to decide which interpretation is correct. Maybe the context suggests that biology is related to reading, or perhaps to math.\n\nLooking back at the problem, it lists math and reading homework separately and then adds \"and 3 more pages of biology homework.\" It doesn't specify that biology is more than reading or more than math, but if I have to choose, perhaps it's more than reading, since math and reading are both specified before biology.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"3 more pages of biology homework\" means that biology homework is simply 3 pages, in addition to the math and reading homework.\n\nBut that would make biology = 3 pages, and math + biology = 8 + 3 = 11 pages.\n\nHowever, that seems inconsistent because if biology is only 3 pages, and reading is 7, it might not make sense to mention biology separately unless it's distinct.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the first interpretation is better: biology is 3 more pages than reading, which is 7 + 3 = 10 pages, and math + biology = 18 pages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that biology is 3 pages, and we should add that to math: 8 + 3 = 11 pages.\n\nBut I think the first interpretation is more likely correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is", "answer": 11, "equiv": false}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": 7, "equiv": true}, {"output": "47", "answer": 47, "equiv": true}, {"output": "350", "answer": 350, "equiv": true}, {"output": "68", "answer": 68, "equiv": true}, {"output": "19", "answer": 19, "equiv": true}, {"output": "22", "answer": 22, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Mary is baking a cake, and the recipe calls for certain amounts of flour and sugar. Specifically, it needs 5 cups of flour and 14 cups of sugar. But Mary has already added some ingredients: she put in 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar. The question is asking how many more cups of sugar she needs to add.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the recipe requires and what Mary has already done. The recipe asks for 5 cups of flour and 14 cups of sugar. Mary has already added 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar. So, it seems like she has added more flour than required and less sugar than required.\n\nBut wait, the problem is only asking about the sugar, so maybe I don't need to worry about the flour right now. However, maybe I should check if the proportions are correct or if she needs to adjust based on the flour she's already added.\n\nLet me see. The recipe calls for 5 cups of flour and 14 cups of sugar. That means the ratio of flour to sugar is 5:14. Mary has added 10 cups of flour, which is double the amount the recipe calls for, because 10 divided by 5 is 2. So, she has added twice as much flour as the recipe requires.\n\nIf she's doubling the recipe, then she should also double the sugar. So, 14 cups of sugar times 2 would be 28 cups of sugar in total. But she has only added 2 cups of sugar so far. Therefore, she needs to add 28 minus 2, which is 26 cups of sugar.\n\nWait a minute, that seems like a lot of sugar. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nThe recipe calls for 5 cups of flour and 14 cups of sugar. Mary has added 10 cups of flour, which is double the amount. So, if she's doubling the recipe, she should add double the sugar, which is 28 cups in total. She has already added 2 cups, so she needs to add 26 more cups of sugar.\n\nBut is there another way to look at this? Maybe the flour and sugar aren't necessarily tied in a proportional way. Maybe she can adjust the amounts independently.\n\nLet me consider that possibility. If Mary has already added 10 cups of flour, which is more than the recipe calls for, but she's still supposed to follow the recipe's sugar amount, which is 14 cups.\n\nIn that case, she would need to add 14 cups of sugar in total, but she's already added 2 cups, so she needs to add 12 more cups of sugar.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that since she doubled the flour, she should also double the sugar. But now, I'm thinking maybe the recipe's sugar amount is fixed, regardless of the flour.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. In most recipes, ingredients are proportional. If you double the flour, you should double the other ingredients as well to keep the proportions correct.\n\nSo, perhaps the first approach is correct. If she's using 10 cups of flour instead of 5, which is double, then she should also double the sugar to 28 cups in total.\n\nSince she's already added 2 cups of sugar, she needs to add 26 more cups.\n\nBut 26 cups of sugar seems like an enormous amount for a cake. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"The recipe calls for 5 cups of flour and 14 cups of sugar. She already put in 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add?\"\n\nHmm, it doesn't specify whether she's adjusting the recipe or not. Maybe she's not following the recipe exactly, and she just wants to know how much more sugar to add to match the recipe's sugar amount, regardless of the flour.\n\nIn that case, if the recipe calls for 14 cups of sugar and she's already added 2 cups, she would need to add 12 more cups to reach the recipe's requirement.\n\nBut, if she's doubling the flour, perhaps she should double the sugar as well.\n\nI think both interpretations are possible, but perhaps the problem expects me to consider that she's adjusting the recipe based on the flour she's already added.\n\nSo, since she's using double the flour, she should use double the sugar. Therefore, she needs 28 cups of sugar in total, and having already added 2 cups, she needs to add 26 more cups.\n\nAlternatively, if she's not changing the recipe and just made a mistake with the flour, then she should still aim for 14 cups of sugar, meaning she needs to add 12 more cups.\n\nGiven that", "answer": 12, "equiv": false}, {"output": "17", "answer": 17, "equiv": true}, {"output": "72", "answer": 72, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "184", "answer": 184, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1092", "answer": 1092, "equiv": true}, {"output": "15", "answer": 15, "equiv": true}, {"output": "14", "answer": 14, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "23", "answer": 23, "equiv": true}, {"output": "14", "answer": 14, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "450", "answer": 450, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this problem about Danny collecting bottle caps and wrappers.

Now he has 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers in his collection.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps \"now he has 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers\" is his entire collection, including what he found at the park.\n\nBut that would mean he had some bottle caps and wrappers before, and then added the ones he found at the park.\n\nWait, but if he found 30 bottle caps and now has 7, that suggests that he had a negative number before, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"now he has 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers in his collection\" is after finding the 30 bottle caps and 14 wrappers at the park.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up either.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nSuppose that Danny had some bottle caps and wrappers initially. He found 30 bottle caps and 14 wrappers at the park, and after adding those to his collection, he has a total of 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers.\n\nSo, if he had b bottle caps initially, then b + 30 = 7. Similarly, if he had w wrappers initially, then w + 14 = 86.\n\nSolving b + 30 = 7, that gives b = 7 - 30 = -23. That's not possible, as he can't have negative bottle caps.\n\nSimilarly, w + 14 = 86, so w = 86 - 14 = 72.\n\nSo, he had 72 wrappers initially, but -23 bottle caps, which doesn't make sense.\n\nThere must be something wrong with my approach.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nMaybe the problem is stating that Danny found 30 bottle caps and 14 wrappers at the park, and then he added them to his collection, which now totals 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers.\n\nBut that would imply that he had a negative number of bottle caps before, which is impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"now he has 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers in his collection\" is separate from what he found at the park.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"He found 30 bottle caps and 14 wrappers at the park. Now he has 7 bottle caps and 86 wrappers in his collection.\"\n\nMaybe he found 30 bottle caps and 14 wrappers, but then he did something else, like giving some away or losing some, which resulted in", "answer": 16, "equiv": false}, {"output": "280", "answer": 280, "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": 8, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So Paul started with a box of 253 crayons. That's a pretty big box, huh? I remember when I was in elementary school, getting a new box of crayons was a big deal. Anyway, by the end of the school year, he had lost or given away 70 of them. I need to figure out how many he has left.\n\nOkay, so this seems like a straightforward subtraction problem. He had 253 crayons and he lost or gave away 70. So, to find out how many he has left, I just need to subtract 70 from 253.\n\nLet me write that down: 253 - 70.\n\nNow, subtracting 70 from 253. I can think of it as subtracting 7 tens from 25 tens. Wait, let's see: 253 is 2 hundreds, 5 tens, and 3 ones. So, 2 hundreds is 200, 5 tens is 50, and 3 ones is 3, which adds up to 253.\n\nIf I'm subtracting 70, which is 7 tens, from 253, I can subtract the tens first. 5 tens minus 7 tens would be negative 2 tens, but that doesn't make sense. So, maybe it's better to subtract the hundreds first.\n\nWait, perhaps I should just perform the subtraction directly:\n\n253\n\n- 70\n\n---\n\nLet's subtract the ones place: 3 minus 0 is 3.\n\nThen the tens place: 5 minus 7. That's not possible without borrowing. But since it's 253, which is 2 hundreds, 5 tens, and 3 ones, I can think of it as 1 hundred and 15 tens.\n\nWait, no. Actually, in subtraction, when you need to borrow, you borrow from the next higher place value.\n\nSo, in 253, the tens place is 5 and the hundreds place is 2.\n\nI need to subtract 7 from the tens place.\n\nSince 5 is less than 7, I need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the hundreds place goes from 2 to 1, and the tens place becomes 15 (because 5 plus 10 is 15).\n\nNow, subtracting 7 from 15 gives me 8.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 1 minus 0 is 1.\n\nThe ones place is still 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, it should be 183.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.\n\n253 - 70:\n\n200 (from 2 hundreds) minus 70 is 130.\n\nThen, add the 50 from the tens and 3 from the ones: 130 + 50 is 180, plus 3 is 183.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 253 minus 70 is like moving 70 steps back from 253.\n\nCounting back: 253 minus 50 is 203, minus 20 is 183.\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, Paul has 183 crayons left by the end of the school year.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says he either lost or given away 70 of them. Does that mean he could have lost some and given away some, but the total is 70?\n\nThe problem says \"he had either lost or given away 70 of them.\" So, it's a total of 70 crayons that are no longer with him, regardless of whether he lost them or gave them away.\n\nSo, the total number of crayons he has left is 253 minus 70, which is 183.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret the problem.\n\nIs there any possibility that some crayons were both lost and given away, or is it just a total of 70 crayons that are missing?\n\nThe problem says \"lost or given away 70 of them.\" The use of \"or\" suggests that it's the total number of crayons that are no longer with him, either because he lost them or because he gave them away.\n\nSo, it's a straightforward subtraction.\n\nAlternatively, if it were \"and,\" meaning he lost some and gave away some, and the numbers were different, then maybe it would be more complex. But since it's \"or,\" it's simply a total of 70 crayons that are gone.\n\nTherefore, 253 minus 70 is indeed 183.\n\nI think", "answer": 183, "equiv": false}, {"output": "482", "answer": 482, "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": 8, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "69", "answer": 69, "equiv": true}, {"output": "20", "answer": 20, "equiv": true}, {"output": "21", "answer": 21, "equiv": true}, {"output": "90", "answer": 90, "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": 10, "equiv": true}, {"output": "11", "answer": 11, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, they're holding a party in their backyard and they've got some tables and chairs set up. The problem says they have 12 sets of tables, and each set has 14 chairs. Additionally, there are 6 extra chairs. I need to find out the total number of chairs they have for the guests.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many chairs are there in the 12 sets. Since each set has 14 chairs, I can multiply the number of sets by the number of chairs per set. So, that's 12 sets times 14 chairs per set.\n\nLet me do that multiplication. 12 times 14. Well, 12 times 10 is 120, and 12 times 4 is 48. Adding those together, 120 plus 48 equals 168. So, there are 168 chairs in the 12 sets.\n\nNow, there are also 6 extra chairs. So, I need to add those to the total. That means 168 plus 6.\n\n168 plus 6 is 174.\n\nTherefore, the total number of chairs they have for the guests is 174.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I can approach it differently to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each table set comes with 14 chairs, and there are 12 such sets, plus 6 extra chairs.\n\nSo, total chairs = (number of sets \u00d7 chairs per set) + extra chairs.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: (12 \u00d7 14) + 6.\n\nI already calculated 12 times 14 as 168, and adding 6 makes 174.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can visualize it. Imagine there are 12 tables, each with 14 chairs. That's 12 groups of 14 chairs. And then there are 6 additional chairs.\n\nI can also think about it in terms of place values. 12 times 14:\n\n12 \u00d7 10 = 120\n\n12 \u00d7 4 = 48\n\nAdding them up: 120 + 48 = 168.\n\nThen, adding the 6 extra chairs: 168 + 6 = 174.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use a different multiplication method, say, breaking down 14 into 10 and 4, as I did before, I get the same result.\n\nOr, I could multiply 12 \u00d7 15, which is 180, and then subtract 12 \u00d7 1, which is 12, to get 168. Because 14 is 15 minus 1.\n\nSo, 12 \u00d7 15 = 180\n\nMinus 12 \u00d7 1 = 12\n\nSo, 180 - 12 = 168.\n\nThen add the 6 extra chairs: 168 + 6 = 174.\n\nAnother way to confirm is to think about the total chairs per table set and then scale it up.\n\nEach set has 14 chairs. So, for 12 sets, it's 12 \u00d7 14 = 168, plus 6 extra chairs = 174.\n\nI think that's consistent across different methods, so I'm confident the answer is 174.\n\nWait, maybe I can check one more way. Let's use addition instead of multiplication.\n\nIf each set has 14 chairs, then adding 14 chairs 12 times.\n\nSo, 14 + 14 + 14 + ... up to 12 times.\n\nAdding them step by step:\n\n14 + 14 = 28\n\n28 + 14 = 42\n\n42 + 14 = 56\n\n56 + 14 = 70\n\n70 + 14 = 84\n\n84 + 14 = 98\n\n98 + 14 = 112\n\n112 + 14 = 126\n\n126 + 14 = 140\n\n140 + 14 = 154\n\n154 + 14 = 168\n\nYes, that matches my earlier multiplication result.\n\nThen, adding the 6 extra chairs: 168 + 6 = 174.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that there are 12 sets of 14 chairs and 6 extra chairs, I can think of it as 12 groups of 14 plus 6.\n\nAlternatively, if I", "answer": 174, "equiv": false}, {"output": "84", "answer": 84, "equiv": true}, {"output": "640", "answer": 640, "equiv": true}, {"output": "26", "answer": 26, "equiv": true}, {"output": "14", "answer": 14, "equiv": true}, {"output": "27", "answer": 27, "equiv": true}, {"output": "65", "answer": 65, "equiv": true}, {"output": "6840", "answer": 6840, "equiv": true}, {"output": "23", "answer": 23, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1542", "answer": 1542, "equiv": true}, {"output": "9", "answer": 9, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. So, the problem says that Lucy went to the grocery store and bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packs of cakes. After her purchase, she had 56 units of change remaining. The question is asking how many packs of groceries she bought in all.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. It seems like the problem is about calculating the total number of packs Lucy bought, given the number of cookie packs and cake packs, and also mentioning some change she had left. But, I'm a bit confused because the change seems unrelated to the total number of packs bought. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Lucy went to the grocery store. She bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packs of cakes. In the end, she had 56 amount of change remaining. How many packs of groceries did she buy in all?\"\n\nHmm, the problem is asking for the total number of packs she bought, which would be the sum of the cookie packs and cake packs. So, 2 packs of cookies plus 12 packs of cakes equals 14 packs in total. But then, there's this mention of 56 units of change remaining. Does this have something to do with the total number of packs?\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's more to this problem. Maybe there's a cost involved, and the change is related to the money she paid. But the problem doesn't mention the cost of the packs or how much money she had initially. If that's the case, maybe the 56 units of change are irrelevant to finding the total number of packs bought.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to say that the total number of packs bought is related to the change she received, but that doesn't make much sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem itself.\n\nLet me consider the straightforward approach first. If Lucy bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packs of cakes, then the total number of packs she bought is simply 2 + 12 = 14 packs.\n\nBut the problem also mentions that she had 56 units of change remaining. If this is part of the problem, perhaps it's meant to distract or it's an additional piece of information that isn't needed for the current question.\n\nGiven that the question is \"How many packs of groceries did she buy in all?\", and assuming that groceries refer to both cookies and cakes, then the total packs would indeed be 14.\n\nHowever, I have a feeling that maybe the problem is incomplete or perhaps I'm missing some information. Maybe there's more to the problem that isn't being shown here.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose that the total number of packs bought is related to the change she received. For example, maybe for every pack bought, she gets some change back, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to say that she bought a certain number of packs and received 56 units of change, and we need to find the total packs based on that. But without knowing the cost per pack or the total amount she paid, it's impossible to determine the total packs based on the change alone.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about solving for an unknown variable, and the 56 units of change are part of an equation. But again, without more information, it's hard to set up such an equation.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other interpretation of the problem. Maybe \"in the end, she had 56 amount of change remaining\" is meant to say that after buying the packs, she had 56 units left, implying that she had a certain amount initially, spent some on the packs, and had 56 remaining.\n\nBut again, without knowing the cost of the packs or the initial amount, I can't determine the total packs bought based on the change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply to add the packs of cookies and cakes, and the mention of change is irrelevant, possibly a typo or a leftover from a different problem.\n\nGiven that, the total packs bought would be 2 + 12 = 14 packs.\n\nBut I'm still uneasy about the inclusion of the change in the problem. Maybe the problem is trying to ask something else, like how much she spent or something similar, but that's not what's being asked.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about calculating the total number of packs bought, and the change is a red herring. In that case, the answer is simply 14 packs.\n\nI think I need to consider that the problem might have a typo or might be incomplete. Given the information provided, the total packs bought are 2 + 12 = 14.\n\nTherefore, my answer is 14 packs.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any possible way that the 56 units of change could affect this total.\n\nSuppose that the change is related to the", "answer": 14, "equiv": false}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "40", "answer": 40, "equiv": true}, {"output": "183", "answer": 183, "equiv": true}, {"output": "127", "answer": 127, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $23 off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they made $230 by selling t-shirts. I need to figure out how many t-shirts they sold.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I know that each t-shirt brings in $23, and the total money made was $230. I need to find out the number of t-shirts sold. This seems like a straightforward division problem, where I divide the total money made by the price per t-shirt.\n\nSo, total money made is $230, and each t-shirt sells for $23. Therefore, the number of t-shirts sold should be $230 divided by $23.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 230 divided by 23.\n\nFirst, I can see that 23 times 10 is 230. So, 23 \u00d7 10 = 230. That means they sold 10 t-shirts.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check that. If they sold 10 t-shirts at $23 each, that should be 10 \u00d7 23 = 230. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of multiplication. If let\u2019s say, the number of t-shirts sold is x, then 23 times x equals 230. So, 23x = 230. To find x, I divide both sides by 23, which gives me x = 230 / 23, which is 10.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to see if there are any remainders. Does 23 go into 230 exactly? Well, 23 times 10 is 230, with no remainder. So, yes, it\u2019s exactly 10 t-shirts.\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need to consider tax or anything like that, because the problem doesn\u2019t mention any additional costs or taxes. It seems like it\u2019s just a straightforward calculation.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I can try another method. Let\u2019s say I subtract 23 from 230 repeatedly until I reach zero.\n\n230 - 23 = 207 (1 t-shirt)\n\n207 - 23 = 184 (2 t-shirts)\n\n184 - 23 = 161 (3 t-shirts)\n\n161 - 23 = 138 (4 t-shirts)\n\n138 - 23 = 115 (5 t-shirts)\n\n115 - 23 = 92 (6 t-shirts)\n\n92 - 23 = 69 (7 t-shirts)\n\n69 - 23 = 46 (8 t-shirts)\n\n46 - 23 = 23 (9 t-shirts)\n\n23 - 23 = 0 (10 t-shirts)\n\nSo, again, I end up with 10 t-shirts sold.\n\nThis matches my initial calculation, so I\u2019m confident that\u2019s the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use algebra, I could set up the equation:\n\nLet x be the number of t-shirts sold.\n\nThen, 23x = 230.\n\nSolving for x: x = 230 / 23 = 10.\n\nSame answer again.\n\nI think it\u2019s clear that the shop sold 10 t-shirts.\n\nJust to make sure there aren\u2019t any tricks here, let me read the problem again: \"The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $23 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game they made $230 by selling t-shirts. How many t-shirts did they sell?\"\n\nIt\u2019s straightforward. There\u2019s no mention of any other costs or revenue sources, so I don\u2019t need to account for anything else.\n\nOne thing that might be a tiny point of confusion is the wording: \"makes $23 dollars off each t-shirt sold.\" Does this mean they make $23 profit per t-shirt, or is it the selling price? In business terms, \"make\" often refers to profit, but in pricing contexts, it could also refer to the revenue per item. However, since the problem doesn\u2019t mention any costs, and it\u2019s just about the money made from sales, I think it\u2019s safe to assume that $23 is the price per t-shirt.\n\nTo put it another way, if $23 is the profit per t-shirt, and there are no other costs mentioned, then the calculation remains the same. If $23 is the selling price, again, the calculation is the same. So, either way, dividing $230 by $23 gives me the number of t-shirts sold.\n\nJust to cover all", "answer": 10, "equiv": false}, {"output": "So I have this math problem here. Randy has 90 blocks.

So, Randy uses 89 blocks for the house and 63 blocks for the tower. I need to find out how many more blocks the house took compared to the tower.\n\nI think I need to subtract the number of blocks used for the tower from the number of blocks used for the house. So, it's 89 minus 63.\n\nLet me do that calculation. 89 minus 63.\n\nFirst, 9 minus 3 is 6, and 80 minus 60 is 20, so 20 plus 6 is 26.\n\nSo, Randy used 26 more blocks to build the house than he did to build the tower.\n\nWait a minute, but let me double-check that.

Do I need to consider that in my calculation?\n\nWait, let's see. He has 90 blocks, and he uses 89 for the house and 63 for the tower. But that seems impossible because 89 plus 63 is more than 90.\n\nWait a second, that doesn't make sense. Unless he is using some blocks for both the house and the tower.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify anything about overlapping blocks. It just says he uses 89 blocks to build a house and 63 blocks to build a tower.\n\nHmm, maybe the initial number of blocks is just to set the context, and the question is only about comparing the blocks used for the house and the tower.\n\nIn that case, ignoring the initial 90 blocks, the difference between 89 and 63 is indeed 26.\n\nBut perhaps there's more to it.

Let's look back at the problem.\n\nIt says she had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards initially, then gave some to Jeff, and now has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit odd because usually, when you give away cards, the number should decrease, but here it's saying she has more cards now than she had initially. Wait, 246 to 404 for baseball cards, and 214 to 495 for Ace cards. That means she has more cards now than before she gave some to Jeff, which doesn't make sense unless Jeff gave her more cards instead of her giving cards to Jeff.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Nell collects cards. She had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left.\"\n\nWait, that seems contradictory. If she gave cards to Jeff, her number of cards should decrease, but here it's increasing. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she had more cards initially and gave some to Jeff, leaving her with 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards. But the initial numbers are given as 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards, which are less than what she has now. This doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial numbers are after she gave cards to Jeff, but that seems unlikely because the wording suggests that she had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards before giving some to Jeff.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that she had more cards initially, and the 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards are what she gave to Jeff. Then, after giving those to Jeff, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left.\n\nBut that would mean she had 404 + 246 = 650 baseball cards initially, and 495 + 214 = 709 Ace cards initially. Then, after giving 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards to Jeff, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left.\n\nBut the problem says \"she had 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards.\" If that's what she had before giving some to Jeff, then unless she received more cards from elsewhere, she can't have more cards after giving some away.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Or perhaps she had more cards initially, and the 246 and 214 are the numbers she gave to Jeff.\n\nLet me try approaching it differently.\n\nAssume that Nell had X baseball cards and Y Ace cards initially.\n\nShe gave away 246 baseball cards and 214 Ace cards to Jeff.\n\nTherefore, she has X - 246 baseball cards and Y - 214 Ace cards left.\n\nAccording to the problem, after giving away those cards, she has 404 baseball cards and 495 Ace cards left.\n\nSo, X - 246 = 404\n\nAnd Y - 21", "answer": 91, "equiv": false}, {"output": "7", "answer": 7, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "48", "answer": 48, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

The total number of cookies is 18, and these are to be divided equally among the guests who actually came.\n\nSo, if there was only 1 guest, it seems like that one guest would get all the cookies. But let's make sure that's what the problem is asking.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says, \"each guest had the same number of cookies.\" Since only one guest came, that single guest would receive all 18 cookies.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something.

Maybe the cookies were prepared with the intention of serving 10 guests, but since only 1 came, perhaps the cookies shouldn't all go to that one guest.\n\nBut according to the problem, the cookies are to be divided equally among the guests who actually came. Since only 1 came, all 18 cookies go to that one guest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cookies were already divided into portions for 10 guests, and since only 1 came, that guest gets their portion.\n\nBut the problem states that she prepared 18 cookies and each guest had the same number of cookies. It doesn't specify whether the cookies were pre-portioned or not.\n\nGiven that, the most straightforward interpretation is that the total cookies are divided equally among the guests who actually came.\n\nSo, 18 cookies divided by 1 guest equals 18 cookies per guest.\n\nBut let's consider if there's another way to look at it.\n\nPerhaps the cookies were meant to be divided among the 10 guests, so each was supposed to get a certain number, but since only 1 came, that guest gets their original portion.\n\nIf that's the case, then each guest was supposed to get 18 cookies divided by 10 guests, which is 1.8 cookies per guest.\n\nBut the problem says that each guest had the same number of cookies, and since only 1 came, that guest would still have the same number that was intended for each guest.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make complete sense because if each guest was supposed to have 1.8 cookies, but you can't really give someone 1.8 cookies if they're individual cookies unless you're cutting cookies into pieces.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify whether cookies can be divided or not.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"each guest had the same number of cookies,\" which suggests that the cookies are being divided equally among the guests who came, regardless of whether they're whole cookies or parts of cookies.\n\nSo, if only 1 guest came, that guest would get all 18 cookies.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because if there were 10 guests, they would each get fewer cookies.\n\nWait, no.

So, that's 18 divided by 6.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 18 divided by 6 equals 3. So, she can make 3 groups of 6 eggs each.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem mentions bananas and marbles too. Maybe I need to consider those as well. Let's read the problem again: \"Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 6. Rebecca has 18 eggs, 72 bananas, and 66 marbles.

Perhaps it's asking for the total number of groups if she splits each type of item into groups of 6.\n\nLet me check that interpretation. If she has 18 eggs, 72 bananas, and 66 marbles, and she splits each into groups of 6, then I need to find the number of groups for each and maybe sum them up.\n\nFirst, for the eggs: 18 eggs divided by 6 per group is 3 groups.\n\nNext, for the bananas: 72 bananas divided by 6 per group is 12 groups.\n\nThen, for the marbles: 66 marbles divided by 6 per group is 11 groups.\n\nNow, if I add up all the groups, that's 3 + 12 + 11, which equals 26 groups in total.\n\nBut wait, the problem specifically says \"split a collection of eggs into groups of 6.\" It doesn't say she's splitting the bananas and marbles into groups of 6 as well. Maybe those other numbers are just additional information that's not relevant to the question being asked.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that Rebecca has a collection that includes eggs, bananas, and marbles, and she wants to split the entire collection into groups of 6 items each, regardless of type.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the total number of items and divide by 6.\n\nLet's see: 18 eggs + 72 bananas + 66 marbles equals 18 + 72 + 66.\n\nCalculating that: 18 + 72 is 90, plus 66 is 156 items in total.\n\nNow, dividing 156 by 6 gives me 26 groups.\n\nThat seems consistent with my earlier calculation where I added up the individual groups.\n\nBut considering the problem's wording, \"split a collection of eggs into groups of 6,\" it seems like it's only about the eggs, not the entire collection.\n\nHowever, the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. It says, \"Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 6. Rebecca has 18 eggs, 72 bananas, and 66 marbles.\"\n\nMaybe it's implying that the collection of eggs is part of a larger collection that includes bananas and marbles, and she wants to split the entire collection into groups of 6.\n\nBut the specific mention of \"a collection of eggs\" makes me think that it's primarily about the eggs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nTo clarify, let's look at the problem again: \"Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 6. Rebecca has 18 eggs, 72 bananas, and 66 marbles.

So, I need to find out the total number of nails John needs for both the large and small planks.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many nails are needed for the large planks. The problem says that all the large planks together need 15 nails. Similarly, all the small planks together need 5 nails.\n\nSo, if I add the nails needed for the large planks and the small planks, that should give me the total number of nails John needs.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal nails = nails for large planks + nails for small planks\n\nGiven that:\n\nNails for large planks = 15\n\nNails for small planks = 5\n\nTherefore:\n\nTotal nails = 15 + 5 = 20\n\nWait a minute, is it that straightforward? Let me double-check the problem to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nThe problem says: \"large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails.\"\n\nYes, it seems clear that the large planks as a group need 15 nails, and the small planks as a group need 5 nails. So, adding them up should give the total nails needed.\n\nBut maybe I should consider whether the number of planks affects the number of nails needed. The problem gives the number of large and small planks, but specifies the total nails needed for each group of planks.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is trying to say that each large plank needs 15 nails, and each small plank needs 5 nails. That would change things significantly.\n\nLet me read the problem again to make sure.\n\n\"large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails.\"\n\nThis phrasing suggests that all the large planks combined need 15 nails, and all the small planks combined need 5 nails.\n\nAlternatively, if it meant each plank needs that many nails, it would probably say \"each large plank needs 15 nails and each small plank needs 5 nails.\"\n\nBut it doesn't say that. It says \"large planks together need 15 pieces of nails\" and \"small planks together need 5 nails.\"\n\nSo, interpreting it as the total nails needed for all large planks is 15, and for all small planks is 5.\n\nTherefore, the total nails needed would be 15 + 5 = 20.\n\nBut maybe there's a trick here that I'm missing. Perhaps there's overlapping need for nails, or some nails secure both large and small planks.\n\nThe problem doesn't mention any overlapping, so I think adding them up directly is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of planks affects the total nails needed per plank.\n\nFor example, if 12 large planks need 15 nails in total, then each large plank would need 15 / 12 = 1.25 nails, which doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a nail in this context.\n\nSimilarly, 10 small planks need 5 nails in total, so each small plank would need 5 / 10 = 0.5 nail, which also doesn't make sense.\n\nThis suggests that the problem might be expecting the total nails needed is simply 15 for large planks and 5 for small planks, totaling 20 nails.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem intends that large planks each need 15 nails, and small planks each need 5 nails, but that seems unlikely because with 12 large planks needing 15 nails each, that would be 12 * 15 = 180 nails, and 10 small planks needing 5 nails each would be 10 * 5 = 50 nails, totaling 230 nails. That seems like a lot, and the initial interpretation leads to only 20 nails, which seems too low.\n\nMaybe I should consider that \"large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails\" means that all large planks combined need 15 nails, and all small planks combined need 5 nails, regardless of the number of planks.\n\nIn that case, total nails needed would indeed be 15 + 5 = 20.\n\nBut to ensure I'm not missing anything, let's consider the context.", "answer": 20, "equiv": false}, {"output": "410", "answer": 410, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this problem here.

How many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?\"\n\nOkay, so first, there's some information here about paintings, but I don't think that's relevant to the problem. It seems like it's just setting the scene. The important numbers are the number of visitors on one day, which is 557, and the number of visitors on the previous day, which is 188. And then it's asking for the total number of visitors over 57 days.\n\nWait, but adding just those two days wouldn't give me the total for 57 days. So maybe there's a pattern or an average or something I need to figure out.\n\nLet me see. If I have the number of visitors on one day and the number on the previous day, maybe I can find a daily average and then multiply by 57.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic because visitors can fluctuate from day to day. Maybe those two days are representative of the kinds of visitor numbers they get, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that those two days are part of the 57 days, and I need to include them in the total.\n\nWait, let's read the problem again carefully.\n\n\"There were 71 paintings in the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day. How many visited the Buckingham palace within 57 days?\"\n\nSo, it mentions specific visitor numbers for two specific days, and then asks for the total visitors over 57 days.\n\nI think I need to find out the average number of visitors per day based on those two days and then multiply by 57.\n\nSo, the total visitors for those two days are 557 + 188 = 745 visitors.\n\nThen, the average per day would be 745 / 2 = 372.5 visitors per day.\n\nThen, for 57 days, the total visitors would be 372.5 * 57.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 372.5 times 50 is 18,625.\n\nThen, 372.5 times 7 is 2,607.5.\n\nAdding those together: 18,625 + 2,607.5 = 21,232.5.\n\nBut you can't have half a visitor, so maybe I should round that to 21,233 visitors.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about averaging or anything like that. Maybe I'm making assumptions here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two days are just examples, and I need to assume that every day has the same number of visitors as one of those days.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to say that the number of visitors changes by a certain amount each day, and I need to find a pattern.\n\nBut it doesn't give any information about the change from day to day.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the two days given are part of the 57 days, and I need to include them in the total.\n\nBut then I still don't know about the other 55 days.\n\nUnless I'm supposed to assume that the visitor numbers repeat every two days.\n\nFor example, one day 557, the next 188, and this pattern repeats.\n\nIf that's the case, then in 57 days, there would be 28 full cycles of two days (since 57 / 2 = 28.5), and then half a cycle.\n\nWait, but 57 divided by 2 is 28.5, so 28 full cycles and one extra day.\n\nEach cycle is 557 + 188 = 745 visitors.\n\nSo, 28 cycles would be 28 * 745 = let's calculate that.\n\n28 * 700 = 19,600\n\n28 * 45 = 1,260\n\nSo, 19,600 + 1,260 = 20,860 visitors.\n\nThen, there's one extra day, which would be the same as one of the two days in the cycle.\n\nBut which one?\n\nWell, the problem mentions \"that day\" and \"the previous day.\" If \"that day\" is the day with 557 visitors, then the cycle would be 5", "answer": 745, "equiv": false}, {"output": "131", "answer": 131, "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": 6, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "37", "answer": 37, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "654", "answer": 654, "equiv": true}, {"output": "34", "answer": 34, "equiv": true}, {"output": "45", "answer": 45, "equiv": true}, {"output": "28", "answer": 28, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: \"Jake has 13 more apples and 17 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 8 peaches and 12 apples. How many apples does Jake have?\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out how many apples Jake has. The problem says that Jake has 13 more apples than Steven. So, if Steven has 12 apples, then Jake should have 12 plus 13 apples. Let me just write that down:\n\nJake's apples = Steven's apples + 13\n\nSteven's apples = 12\n\nSo, Jake's apples = 12 + 13 = 25\n\nWait, but the problem also mentions peaches. It says Jake has 17 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 8 peaches, so Jake should have 8 - 17 peaches. But that would be negative number of peaches, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Jake has 13 more apples and 17 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 8 peaches and 12 apples.\" The question is, how many apples does Jake have?\n\nOkay, so it's giving me Steven's quantities: 8 peaches and 12 apples. Then, Jake has 13 more apples than Steven and 17 fewer peaches than Steven.\n\nSo, for apples:\n\nJake's apples = Steven's apples + 13 = 12 + 13 = 25 apples.\n\nFor peaches:\n\nJake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 17 = 8 - 17 = -9.\n\nBut negative peaches don't make sense. Maybe the problem is trying to say something else. Perhaps it's a trick question, and I'm supposed to realize that the number of peaches can't be negative, so maybe I should interpret it differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way the sentence is structured is confusing me. Let's look at the sentence again: \"Jake has 13 more apples and 17 fewer peaches than Steven.\"\n\nThis seems clear: Jake's apples = Steven's apples + 13, and Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 17.\n\nGiven that Steven has 12 apples and 8 peaches, plugging in the numbers gives:\n\nJake's apples = 12 + 13 = 25\n\nJake's peaches = 8 - 17 = -9\n\nBut again, -9 peaches doesn't make sense. Maybe the problem expects me to only consider positive quantities and just answer the number of apples Jake has, which is 25.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem itself. Maybe it should have said \"17 more peaches than Steven,\" but that would make more sense. Or maybe Steven has more peaches than stated.\n\nBut based on what's written, if I follow the instructions directly, Jake has 25 apples.\n\nMaybe I should check if there's another way to interpret \"Jake has 13 more apples and 17 fewer peaches than Steven.\"\n\nPerhaps it's meant to be read as: Jake has 13 more apples than Steven, and also, Jake has 17 fewer peaches than Steven.\n\nWhich is how I interpreted it initially.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's meant to be read as: Jake has 13 more apples than Steven has peaches.\n\nWait, that would be different. That would mean Jake's apples = Steven's peaches + 13.\n\nBut that wouldn't make much sense because Steven's peaches are 8, so Jake would have 8 + 13 = 21 apples.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with the first part.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Jake has 13 more apples and 17 fewer peaches than Steven.\"\n\nThis seems like it's comparing apples to apples and peaches to peaches.\n\nSo, Jake's apples = Steven's apples + 13\n\nJake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 17\n\nBut as I said earlier, that leads to a negative number of peaches for Jake, which is impractical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"and\" is meant to connect two separate comparisons, but I think my initial interpretation is correct.\n\nGiven that, and considering the question is only asking for the number of apples Jake has, which according to my calculation is 25, perhaps that's the answer.\n\nBut I'm still bothered by the negative number of peaches. Maybe I should consider that Jake has no peaches, but that would contradict the problem's statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to teach me that in real life, negative quantities don't make sense, and I should recognize that the scenario is impossible.\n\nHowever, since the question is specifically about the number of apples Jake has, and that comes", "answer": 25, "equiv": false}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven.\n\n2. Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill.\n\n3. Steven has 4 peaches.\n\nAnd finally, it asks how many more peaches Jill has than Jake.\n\nAlright, let's start by figuring out how many peaches each person has.\n\nFirst, we know that Steven has 4 peaches.\n\nSo, Steven = 4 peaches.\n\nNext, it says that Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill. So, if Steven has 4 peaches, and he has 11 more than Jill, then Jill must have fewer peaches than Steven.\n\nTo find out how many peaches Jill has, I can set up the equation:\n\nSteven = Jill + 11\n\nBut we know Steven has 4 peaches, so:\n\n4 = Jill + 11\n\nNow, to find Jill's peaches, I need to subtract 11 from 4:\n\nJill = 4 - 11 = -7\n\nWait, that can't be right.

This suggests that Jill has negative peaches, which is impossible.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my interpretation.\n\nLet me double-check the problem:\n\n\"Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven who has 11 more peaches than Jill.

But no, it clearly says \"11 more.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a misinterpretation in the language.\n\nLet me try rephrasing:\n\nSteven has 4 peaches.\n\nSteven has 11 more peaches than Jill.\n\nSo, Jill has 4 - 11 = -7 peaches.\n\nThis suggests a mistake in the problem setup because having negative peaches isn't logical in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that Jill has 11 more peaches than Steven.\n\nLet me check that:\n\nIf Jill has 11 more peaches than Steven, and Steven has 4 peaches, then Jill would have 4 + 11 = 15 peaches.\n\nThat makes more sense.\n\nBut the problem says \"Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill,\" so my first interpretation should be correct, leading to Jill having -7 peaches, which is impossible.\n\nPerhaps the problem has a typo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that \"Steven who has 11 more peaches than Jill\" is a separate clause and not directly related to the first part.\n\nWait, let's look at the sentence structure:\n\n\"Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven who has 11 more peaches than Jill. Steven has 4 peaches. How many more peaches does Jill have than Jake?\"\n\nSo, \"Steven who has 11 more peaches than Jill\" is a descriptive clause about Steven.\n\nGiven that Steven has 4 peaches, and he has 11 more than Jill, then Jill has 4 - 11 = -7 peaches, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests there might be an error in the problem itself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that Steven has 11 fewer peaches than Jill.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nIf Steven has 11 fewer peaches than Jill, then Steven = Jill - 11.\n\nGiven Steven has 4 peaches:\n\n4 = Jill - 11\n\nJill = 4 + 11 = 15 peaches.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nBut the problem says \"Steven has 11 more peaches than Jill,\" not fewer.\n\nI'm getting confused here.

So, the problem is about the \"crazy silly school\" series, and there are some books and movies in it. It says there are 10 different books and 6 different movies in the series. Then, it mentions that you read 14 of the movies and watched 19 of the books. Wait a minute, that seems a bit off because there are only 6 movies and 10 books. How can you read 14 movies if there are only 6? Maybe there's a mistake in the problem.\n\nLet me read it again: \"There are 10 different books and 6 different movies in the 'crazy silly school' series. If you read 14 of the movies and watched 19 of the books. How many more books than movies have you read?\"\n\nHmm, it seems like there might be a typo here. Probably, it should be \"you watched 14 of the movies and read 19 of the books.\" That would make more sense because you can't read movies; you watch them, and you read books. So, maybe it's just a mix-up in the wording.\n\nAssuming that, let's proceed with: you watched 14 movies and read 19 books from the series.\n\nNow, the question is asking for how many more books than movies you have read. So, I need to find the difference between the number of books read and the number of movies watched.\n\nFirst, let's note down the numbers:\n\n- Total books in the series: 10\n\n- Total movies in the series: 6\n\n- Books read: 19\n\n- Movies watched: 14\n\nWait, again, that doesn't make sense because there are only 10 books and 6 movies. How can you read 19 books if there are only 10? Maybe the numbers are supposed to be different. Perhaps it's a typo and it should be 10 and 6 respectively.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"14\" and \"19\" are supposed to be something else. Let me consider the possibility that it's supposed to be fractions or something, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother thought: maybe \"crazy silly school\" has more than just 10 books and 6 movies, and those numbers are just what's available, but you've read and watched more from different series or something. But that would make the problem too open-ended.\n\nI think the best approach is to assume that the problem meant to say that there are more books and movies in the series, and you've read and watched the given numbers.\n\nSo, assuming that there are more than 10 books and 6 movies in the series, and you've read 19 books and watched 14 movies, then the difference would be:\n\nNumber of books read - number of movies watched = 19 - 14 = 5\n\nSo, you've read 5 more books than movies.\n\nBut, considering the initial numbers provided, it's confusing. Maybe the problem is trying to say that there are 10 books and 6 movies in total, and you've read some of them, but the numbers don't add up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"14\" and \"19\" are supposed to be decimals or percentages, but that doesn't seem right in this context.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem is trying to say that you've read 14 movies and watched 19 books, which doesn't make sense because you can't read movies or watch books. So, perhaps it's a typo and it should be \"you've watched 14 movies and read 19 books.\"\n\nGiven that, the difference would be 19 - 14 = 5 books more than movies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are supposed to be smaller. For example, maybe it's \"you've read 4 movies and 9 books,\" which would give a difference of 5.\n\nBut according to the problem as stated, with the numbers given, it doesn't make sense because you can't watch more movies than exist in the series.\n\nGiven that, I think the problem might have a typo, and the correct interpretation is that you've watched all 6 movies and read all 10 books, but the numbers provided don't align with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the series has more than 10 books and 6 movies, and you've read 19 books and watched 14 movies, making the difference 5.\n\nIn any case, based on the information provided, the difference would be 19 - 14 = 5.\n\nTherefore, you've read 5 more books than movies.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another angle. Maybe the problem is trying to say that you've read 14 movies and watched 19 books, but since that's not possible, perhaps it's a trick question, and", "answer": 5, "equiv": false}, {"output": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let's read it carefully:\n\n\"Debby bought 301 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 144 bottles a day for some days. If she has 157 bottles left. How many days did she drink for?\"\n\nAlright, so Debby started with 301 water bottles. She drank 144 bottles each day for a certain number of days, and after that, she has 157 bottles left. I need to find out how many days she drank for.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many bottles she drank in total. She started with 301 and has 157 left, so the total number of bottles she drank is 301 minus 157.\n\nLet me calculate that: 301 - 157.\n\n300 - 150 is 150, and 1 - 7... oh, wait, I need to borrow. Actually, it's easier to think of it as 301 minus 157.\n\n301 - 150 = 151, and then 151 - 7 = 144. So, she drank a total of 144 bottles.\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right because if she drank 144 bottles a day, and the total she drank is also 144 bottles, that would mean she only drank for one day. But let's check the numbers again.\n\n301 - 157 should be 144. Let me verify: 157 + 144 = 301. Yes, that's correct. So, she drank 144 bottles in total.\n\nBut the problem says she drinks 144 bottles a day. So, if she drank 144 bottles in total, and she drinks 144 bottles each day, then she must have drunk for one day.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Debby bought 301 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 144 bottles a day for some days. If she has 157 bottles left. How many days did she drink for?\"\n\nSo, she drinks 144 bottles each day, and she has 157 left after drinking for some number of days. The total she drank is 301 - 157 = 144 bottles.\n\nSo, total bottles drunk is 144 bottles.\n\nShe drinks 144 bottles per day.\n\nTherefore, number of days = total bottles drunk / bottles per day = 144 / 144 = 1 day.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but maybe there's a trick here.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. If she drinks 144 bottles a day and has 157 left, but she only drank 144 in total, which is less than the amount she drinks in one day, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that she drank for multiple days, and the total drunk is more than 144.\n\nWait, no, the total drunk is 144 bottles.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that she drank 144 bottles a day, and after drinking for some days, she has 157 left, but 144 bottles per day is more than the total she drank, which is 144 bottles.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try setting up an equation.\n\nLet d be the number of days she drank.\n\nEach day, she drinks 144 bottles.\n\nSo, total drunk = 144 * d.\n\nShe started with 301 bottles, so:\n\n301 - 144*d = 157.\n\nNow, solve for d:\n\n301 - 157 = 144*d,\n\n144 = 144*d,\n\nd = 144 / 144,\n\nd = 1.\n\nSo, according to this, she drank for 1 day.\n\nBut, wait, if she drank 144 bottles in one day, and she had 301 to start with, then 301 - 144 = 157, which matches the problem.\n\nSo, the answer is 1 day.\n\nMaybe the confusion came from misreading the problem. The problem says \"if she drank 144 bottles a day for some days.\" The \"a day\" might be misleading me into thinking it's multiple days, but according to the calculation, it's just one day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem, and it should have different numbers", "answer": 1, "equiv": false}, {"output": "2184", "answer": 2184, "equiv": true}, {"output": "20", "answer": 20, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this math problem here: \"The grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 31 inches and the frog jumped 35 inches. How much did they jump altogether?\" Okay, so I need to find out the total distance both of them jumped together.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It seems straightforward. There are two jumps: one by the grasshopper and one by the frog. I need to add those two distances together to get the total jump distance.\n\nSo, the grasshopper jumped 31 inches, and the frog jumped 35 inches. To find the total, I should add these two numbers: 31 + 35.\n\nLet me think about how to add them. I can add the tens and then the ones. 30 plus 30 is 60, and 1 plus 5 is 6. So, 60 plus 6 is 66 inches.\n\nAlternatively, I can use column addition. Let me write it down:\n\n```\n\n  31\n\n+ 35\n\n---\n\n```\n\nStarting from the right, 1 plus 5 is 6. Then, 3 plus 3 is 6. So, it's 66 inches.\n\nWait a minute, I should make sure that I'm adding correctly. Maybe I can check my work. Let me use another method, like counting up.\n\nStarting from 31, if I add 35 to it, I can break it down. First, add 30 to 31, which is 61. Then add the remaining 5: 61 plus 5 is 66.\n\nAlternatively, I could add 31 and 35 by thinking of it as 30 + 30 which is 60, and then add the 1 and 5, which is 6, so 60 + 6 is 66.\n\nHmm, all these methods give me the same answer, 66 inches. I think that's correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to approach this. Maybe using subtraction to check the addition. If I have the total jump distance is 66 inches, and I subtract the grasshopper's jump of 31 inches, I should get the frog's jump of 35 inches.\n\nSo, 66 - 31 = 35. Let's check: 66 minus 30 is 36, and then minus 1 is 35. Yes, that checks out.\n\nSimilarly, if I subtract the frog's jump from the total: 66 - 35 should equal the grasshopper's jump of 31 inches.\n\n66 minus 35: 66 minus 30 is 36, and minus 5 is 31. That also checks out.\n\nOkay, so all my methods confirm that the total jump distance is 66 inches.\n\nI should make sure that I'm answering the question correctly. The question asks, \"How much did they jump altogether?\" So, the answer should be the total distance, which is 66 inches.\n\nI think that's straightforward enough. However, just to be careful, I'll read the question again to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\n\"The grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 31 inches and the frog jumped 35 inches. How much did they jump altogether?\"\n\nYes, it's clear. I need to add the two jumps together.\n\nWait a second, I recall that sometimes in word problems, there might be tricks or additional steps that aren't immediately obvious. Is there any chance that this problem might be asking for something else, like the difference in their jumps or something similar?\n\nNo, the question specifically says \"how much did they jump altogether?\" Which indicates that I need to find the sum of their jumps.\n\nAdditionally, the problem is about a jumping contest, but I don't think that affects the mathematical operation I need to perform. It's just providing a context for the problem.\n\nI should also consider the units. Both jumps are given in inches, so the total should also be in inches. I don't need to convert any units in this problem.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the jumps were in the same direction or not. But since the problem is about a jumping contest and doesn't specify any direction, I think it's safe to assume that we're just adding the distances regardless of direction.\n\nMoreover, I should consider if there's any need to average the jumps or find any other measure, but again, the question clearly asks for the total jump distance.\n\nLet me think about it differently.

I need to figure out how many pieces go into each bag.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"equally\" means. It means that each bag should have the same number of pieces of candy. So, I need to divide the total number of candies by the number of bags.\n\nThe total number of candies is 16, and the number of bags is 2. So, I should divide 16 by 2.\n\nLet me write that down: 16 \u00f7 2.\n\nNow, I know that division is about splitting things into equal parts. So, 16 divided by 2 means splitting 16 into 2 equal parts.\n\nI can think of it in terms of multiplication too. If each bag has a certain number of candies, say x, then 2 times x should equal 16. So, 2 * x = 16. To find x, I need to divide both sides by 2, which gives me x = 16 \u00f7 2.\n\nAgain, that's 16 divided by 2.\n\nNow, I know that 16 divided by 2 is 8. Because 2 times 8 is 16.\n\nLet me check that: 2 * 8 = 16. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, each bag should have 8 pieces of candy.\n\nWait a minute, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using subtraction.\n\nIf Frank has 16 candies and he puts some into the first bag, and the rest into the second bag, and he wants both bags to have the same amount, then he could keep subtracting equal amounts from the total until he reaches zero.\n\nFor example, he could put 1 candy into each bag alternately until he's out of candies.\n\nSo, starting with 16 candies:\n\n- Put 1 candy in bag 1: 15 left.\n\n- Put 1 candy in bag 2: 14 left.\n\n- Put 1 candy in bag 1: 13 left.\n\n- Put 1 candy in bag 2: 12 left.\n\n- And so on, until he has 0 left.\n\nAt the end, each bag would have 8 candies.\n\nThat matches what I got earlier by dividing 16 by 2.\n\nIs there another way to look at this problem?\n\nMaybe using addition. If each bag has the same number of candies, and together they add up to 16, then I can think of it as finding a number that, when added to itself, equals 16.\n\nSo, x + x = 16.\n\nThat simplifies to 2x = 16.\n\nThen, x = 16 \u00f7 2 = 8.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about fractions. If Frank divides his candies into 2 equal parts, each part is half of the total.\n\nHalf of 16 is 8.\n\nSo, each bag gets 8 candies.\n\nI'm getting the same answer no matter how I approach it, which makes me confident that 8 is the correct number of candies per bag.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should be considering. Is there anything in the problem that suggests it's not that straightforward?\n\nThe problem says \"Frank put some pieces of candy equally into 2 bags\" and \"he had 16 pieces of candy.\" It's pretty straightforward. There doesn't seem to be any trick here.\n\nSo, I think it's safe to conclude that each bag has 8 pieces of candy.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"some pieces of candy.\" Does \"some\" mean that he didn't necessarily put all the candies into the bags?\n\nHmm, that's a thought. Maybe he only put part of the candies into the bags, and kept some for himself.\n\nBut the problem says he \"put some pieces of candy equally into 2 bags.\" It doesn't specify if he put all of them into the bags or just some of them.\n\nHowever, the way it's phrased, it seems like he put all the candies into the bags, with each bag getting an equal share.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"some\" refers to an unspecified number, but the fact that he had 16 pieces suggests that the \"some\" refers to the 16 pieces he had.\n\nBut that would mean he put all 16 pieces into the 2 bags equally.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is likely expecting a straightforward division: 16 candies divided equally into 2 bags means 8 candies per bag.\n\nI shouldn't read too much into the word \"some.\" In this context, it probably just means an unspecified number, but since he had 16, it's implied that he put all 16 into the bags equally.\n\nSo", "answer": 8, "equiv": false}, {"output": "18", "answer": 18, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "14", "answer": 14, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "9", "answer": 9, "equiv": true}, {"output": "78", "answer": 78, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have some birds and storks sitting on a fence, and then more storks come to join them. We need to find out how many birds and storks are sitting on the fence after the new storks arrive.\n\nFirst, let's identify what we know:\n\n- There are 3 birds sitting on the fence.\n\n- There are 4 storks sitting on the fence.\n\n- Then, 6 more storks come to join them.\n\nSo, the total number of storks after the new ones join would be the original 4 storks plus the 6 that came to join them. That means:\n\n4 storks + 6 storks = 10 storks\n\nNow, the number of birds remains the same because no more birds came to join them. So, there are still 3 birds on the fence.\n\nTo find the total number of birds and storks on the fence, we need to add the number of birds and the number of storks together:\n\n3 birds + 10 storks = 13\n\nSo, there are 13 birds and storks sitting on the fence in total.\n\nWait a minute, but the question asks for the number of birds and storks separately, and also together. Let's make sure we're answering the right question. The problem says, \"How many birds and storks are sitting on the fence?\"\n\nHmm, it might be asking for the total number of birds and storks combined, which we've calculated as 13. But sometimes, questions like this might expect the numbers separately. Let's see.\n\nWe have 3 birds and 10 storks, making a total of 13.\n\nBut to be precise, perhaps it's asking for the total number of birds (which includes both birds and storks), but that doesn't make sense because storks are a type of bird. Wait, in this context, it seems that \"birds\" and \"storks\" are being distinguished, so maybe \"birds\" here refers to non-stork birds.\n\nSo, perhaps the total number of birds (non-stork birds) is 3, and the number of storks is 10, making a total of 13 birds and storks.\n\nBut the problem seems to consider storks separately from birds, so maybe \"birds\" here does not include storks.\n\nAlternatively, if storks are considered a type of bird, then the total number of birds would be all birds plus all storks.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let's look at the problem again.\n\n\"3 birds and 4 storks were sitting on the fence. 6 more storks came to join them. How many birds and storks are sitting on the fence?\"\n\nSo, it mentions \"birds and storks\" separately, and then storks join them. It seems that storks are being distinguished from birds in this context. Maybe \"birds\" here refers to non-stork birds.\n\nSo, if we have 3 birds (not storks) and 4 storks initially, and then 6 more storks join, the total number of birds (non-storks) remains 3, and the total number of storks becomes 4 + 6 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the total number of birds and storks combined is 3 + 10 = 13.\n\nAlternatively, if storks are considered a type of bird, then the total number of birds would be all birds plus all storks, which would be the same 13.\n\nBut given that the problem distinguishes between \"birds\" and \"storks,\" it might be that \"birds\" here does not include storks.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps the best way is to add them all together as 13 birds and storks.\n\nBut let's consider the context of the problem. If storks are a type of bird, then adding birds and storks would be redundant, as storks are already birds.\n\nWait, biologically, storks are indeed birds, belonging to the Ciconiiformes order. So, in biological classification, storks are birds.\n\nHowever, in the context of this problem, it seems that \"birds\" and \"storks\" are being treated as separate categories, perhaps for simplicity in counting.\n\nGiven that, it's likely that in this problem, \"birds\" refers to birds that are not storks, and \"storks\" are a separate category.\n\nSo, with that in mind, we have:\n\n- 3 birds (not storks)\n\n- 4 storks initially\n\n- 6 more storks join\n\nTotal birds (not storks): 3\n\nTotal storks: 4 + 6 = 10\n\nTotal birds and storks combined: 3 + 10 = 13\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 13.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider if the problem is asking for the total number of", "answer": 13, "equiv": false}, {"output": "35", "answer": 35, "equiv": true}, {"output": "41", "answer": 41, "equiv": true}, {"output": "19", "answer": 19, "equiv": true}, {"output": "13", "answer": 13, "equiv": true}, {"output": "26", "answer": 26, "equiv": true}, {"output": "63", "answer": 63, "equiv": true}, {"output": "11", "answer": 11, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "32", "answer": 32, "equiv": true}, {"output": "\\dfrac{1}{332}", "answer": 332, "equiv": false}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

That seems a bit tricky because you can't throw away more roses than you have. Hmm, maybe it's a mistake, or perhaps I'm misreading it.\n\nLet me read it again: \"There were 2 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 4 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 23 roses in the vase. How many roses did she cut?\"\n\nOkay, so it says she threw away 4 roses from the vase, but there were only 2. Maybe it's a typo in the problem, or perhaps it's meant to be interpreted differently. Maybe she threw away 4 that were outside the vase or something. But that doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she threw away 4 roses that were already in the vase, but since there were only 2, perhaps she threw away all 2 and then somehow more? That doesn't add up. Maybe I should consider that she threw away 4 roses, but she didn't have that many, so now she has a negative number? Wait, that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nLet me consider that maybe the problem meant she removed 4 roses, but since there were only 2, she removed all 2, and then perhaps she couldn't remove any more, so effectively, she only removed 2. But the problem says she threw away 4. I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it should say she added 4 roses instead of threw away 4. But that doesn't align with the rest of the problem.\n\nLet me try to approach this differently. Let's list out the events in order:\n\n1. Start with 2 roses in the vase.\n\n2. Jessica throws away 4 roses from the vase.\n\n3. Jessica cuts some new roses from her garden and puts them in the vase.\n\n4. Now there are 23 roses in the vase.\n\nWe need to find out how many new roses she cut from her garden.\n\nLet me denote the number of new roses she cut as x.\n\nNow, let's think about the sequence of events:\n\n- Start with 2 roses.\n\n- Throw away 4 roses. But hold on, you can't throw away more roses than you have. So, if you have only 2 roses and you throw away 4, maybe it means you throw away all 2 and still need to account for the additional 2 that you don't have.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that she threw away 4 roses that were outside the vase or something. That doesn't make much sense.\n\nMaybe it's simpler than I'm making it. Perhaps she had 2 roses, threw away 4, which left her with -2 roses (which doesn't make practical sense), and then she added x roses to make it 23. So, -2 + x = 23, which would mean x = 25.\n\nBut having -2 roses doesn't make sense in the real world. Maybe I need to consider that she threw away 4 roses from somewhere else, not from the vase.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is meant to be that she threw away 4 roses from her garden or somewhere else, not from the vase. But the problem says she threw away 4 roses from the vase.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should just focus on the numbers and ignore the practicality.\n\nSo, starting with 2 roses, threw away 4, which would leave 2 - 4 = -2 roses, then added x roses to make it 23. So, -2 + x = 23, hence x = 25.\n\nBut again, negative roses don't make sense. Maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and it should be \"added 4 roses\" instead of \"threw away 4 roses.\"\n\nAssuming that's the case, starting with 2 roses, added 4 roses, then added x roses to make it 23. So, 2 + 4 + x = 23, which simplifies to 6 + x = 23, hence x = 17.\n\nThat seems more reasonable, but the problem clearly says \"threw away 4 roses.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4 roses thrown away were different from the roses in the vase. Maybe she threw away 4 roses from her garden before cutting some to put in the vase.\n\nBut that interpretation isn't clear from the problem statement.\n\nI think I need to stick with the original approach:\n\n- Start with 2 roses.\n\n- Throw away 4 roses from the vase (even though that's more than what's there, maybe she", "answer": 25, "equiv": false}, {"output": "26", "answer": 16, "equiv": false}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "807", "answer": 807, "equiv": true}, {"output": "18", "answer": 18, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "43", "answer": 43, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "17", "answer": 17, "equiv": true}, {"output": "158", "answer": 158, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1081", "answer": 1081, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now?\"\n\nHmm, it's a bit confusing. It says \"together they collected 22 pounds,\" and then \"Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds.\" So, perhaps the 30 pounds found were added to Marco's collection specifically.\n\nLet me consider that possibility.\n\nIf Marco's strawberries went from \\( m \\) pounds to 36 pounds, and his dad found 30 more pounds, maybe those 30 pounds were added to Marco's strawberries.\n\nSo, in that case:\n\n\\[ m + 30 = 36 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( m \\):\n\n\\[ m = 36 - 30 = 6 \\] pounds\n\nThen, since initially, together they had 22 pounds:\n\n\\[ m + d = 22 \\]\n\n\\[ 6 + d = 22 \\]\n\n\\[ d = 22 - 6 = 16 \\] pounds\n\nNow, his dad found an additional 30 pounds, so his dad's strawberries now weigh:\n\n\\[ d + 30 = 16 + 30 = 46 \\] pounds\n\nWait, but the problem asks for his dad's strawberries now, which would be after his dad found the 30 pounds.\n\nBut let me double-check if my assumption is correct. The problem says \"Marco's strawberries now weighed 36 pounds.\" If his dad found 30 pounds and added them to Marco's strawberries, then yes, Marco's strawberries would be his initial \\( m \\) plus 30 pounds, which equals 36 pounds.\n\nThat seems logical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 30 pounds were added to the total collection, and then they divided them in some way.

If Marco's strawberries now weigh 36 pounds, then his dad's strawberries would be 52 - 36 = 16 pounds.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the 30 pounds were specifically added to Marco", "answer": 16, "equiv": false}, {"output": "13", "answer": 13, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

If she had only grown 3 trees initially, and 13 died, that doesn't make sense because you can't have more trees dying than there were to begin with.

But that also seems unclear.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem to understand it better.\n\nIt appears that Haley had some trees in her backyard, out of which she had grown 3 trees initially. Then, a typhoon hit, and 13 trees died. Now, we need to find how many more trees died than those that survived.\n\nWait, but if she had only grown 3 trees initially, and 13 died, it's impossible unless there were more trees beyond the 3 she grew.\n\nMaybe the problem means that she had some trees, she grew 3 more, and then 13 died. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem itself.\n\nLet me consider that she had some trees, say x trees initially, and she grew 3 more, so total trees before the typhoon were x + 3.

Maybe there's a typo in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"she had grown 3 trees initially\" refers to the number of trees that survived, and 13 died.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense with the wording.\n\nLet me look at the question again: \"How many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived?\"\n\nSo, if S is the number of trees that survived, and D is the number that died, then the answer is D - S.\n\nWe know that D = 13, and S = total trees initially - D.\n\nBut total trees initially is not given directly.\n\nWait, perhaps \"she had grown 3 trees initially\" means that she had 3 trees initially, and no others.\n\nIf that's the case, then total trees initially is 3.\n\nSo, S = total initially - D = 3 - 13.\n\nBut that would be negative, which doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, there must be something wrong with this interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"she had grown 3 trees initially\" means that she had 3 trees that she grew, in addition to some existing trees in the backyard.\n\nBut again, without knowing the number of existing trees, I can't proceed.\n\nThis problem seems to have unclear wording, leading to confusion about the initial number of trees.\n\nPerhaps the intended meaning is that Haley had grown 3 trees in her backyard, and after the typhoon, 13 trees died.

So, Paige originally had some goldfish and catfish in her pond. Specifically, she had 16 goldfish and 71 catfish. That means the total number of fish she had initially was 16 + 71, right? Let's add those up: 16 plus 70 is 86, and adding the remaining 1 makes it 87. So, she had 87 fish in total at the beginning.\n\nNow, the problem says that some stray cats loved eating them, and now she has only 2 left. So, the number of fish that disappeared would be the initial total minus what's left. That is 87 minus 2, which equals 85 fish that disappeared.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking how many goldfish disappeared. Hmm, that requires a bit more thinking. We know that both goldfish and catfish were eaten, but we need to find out how many goldfish were lost.\n\nLet me see. Let's denote the number of goldfish that disappeared as G and the number of catfish that disappeared as C. We know that G + C = 85, since that's the total number of fish that disappeared.\n\nBut we don't have enough information to directly solve for G and C separately. We need another equation or some additional information to relate G and C.\n\nWait a minute, we do know how many goldfish and catfish she had initially. She had 16 goldfish and 71 catfish. After some disappeared, she has 2 fish left in total.\n\nLet's think about how many goldfish and catfish are left. Suppose she has G_gold left and G_cat left, where G_gold is the number of goldfish left and G_cat is the number of catfish left. We know that G_gold + G_cat = 2.\n\nAlso, we can express G_gold as the initial number of goldfish minus the number that disappeared: G_gold = 16 - G.\n\nSimilarly, G_cat = 71 - C.\n\nSince G_gold + G_cat = 2, we can substitute the expressions:\n\n(16 - G) + (71 - C) = 2\n\nSimplifying that: 16 - G + 71 - C = 2 \u2192 87 - G - C = 2.\n\nWe already know that G + C = 85, so plugging that in: 87 - 85 = 2, which checks out.\n\nBut that doesn't help us find G directly. Maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet's consider that the total number of fish that disappeared is 85, and we need to find out how many of those were goldfish, given that she had only 16 to begin with.\n\nWait a second, she only had 16 goldfish initially. If 85 fish disappeared, but she only had 16 goldfish, it's impossible for more than 16 goldfish to have disappeared. So, the maximum number of goldfish that could have disappeared is 16.\n\nBut she has 2 fish left in total. If she had 16 goldfish and 71 catfish initially, and now has 2 fish left, it's likely that most of the fish that disappeared were catfish, since there were many more catfish.\n\nLet me try to find out how many catfish disappeared. She had 71 catfish initially. If she has 2 fish left, and assuming that some of those are catfish, we need to find out how many catfish are left.\n\nBut we don't know how many of the remaining 2 are goldfish or catfish. That's complicating things.\n\nMaybe I should think about it differently. Let's assume that X goldfish disappeared and Y catfish disappeared, with X \u2264 16 and Y \u2264 71, and X + Y = 85.\n\nAlso, the remaining goldfish are 16 - X and the remaining catfish are 71 - Y, and their sum is 2: (16 - X) + (71 - Y) = 2.\n\nSimplifying: 16 - X + 71 - Y = 2 \u2192 87 - (X + Y) = 2 \u2192 87 - 85 = 2, which is consistent.\n\nBut I need to find X, the number of goldfish that disappeared.\n\nLet me consider that she has 2 fish left, which could be a combination of goldfish and catfish. But since goldfish are fewer, it's possible that some or all of the remaining 2 are catfish.\n\nWait, another approach: since she had 71 catfish and only 2 fish left in total, it's likely that most catfish are gone.

How many more tickets did Dave use to buy clothes than he did to buy toys?\"\n\nAlright, first, Dave won 13 tickets. Then, he used some of those tickets to buy toys and some to buy clothes. Specifically, he used 8 tickets for toys and 18 more for clothes. The question is asking how many more tickets he used for clothes compared to toys.\n\nWait a minute, there's something here that doesn't add up. Dave started with 13 tickets, but he used 8 for toys and then 18 more for clothes. That means in total, he used 8 + 18 = 26 tickets. But he only had 13 tickets to begin with. That seems impossible because he can't use more tickets than he has.\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Dave had won 13 tickets. If he used 8 to buy some toys and 18 more to buy some clothes. How many more tickets did Dave use to buy clothes than he did to buy toys?\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the \"18 more to buy some clothes\" is not an absolute number but rather 18 more than what he used for toys. In that case, he used 8 tickets for toys and 8 + 18 = 26 tickets for clothes. But again, that doesn't make sense because he only has 13 tickets.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"18 more\" means in addition to what he used for toys. So, he used 8 for toys and then another 18 for clothes, totaling 26 tickets, but again, he only has 13.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I'm overthinking it. Let's consider the possibility that the 18 is not additional but somehow related differently.\n\nWait, the problem says \"used 8 to buy some toys and 18 more to buy some clothes.\" Maybe it's saying he used 8 tickets for toys and then used 18 more tickets for clothes on top of the initial 8.\n\nBut that would mean he used 8 + 18 = 26 tickets, which is more than he has. So, perhaps the \"18 more\" is not meaning an additional 18 beyond the 8, but rather that he used 18 tickets for clothes, separate from the 8 used for toys.\n\nBut even then, 8 for toys and 18 for clothes still totals 26, which exceeds his 13 tickets.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the problem itself. Perhaps it's a typo and he had more tickets to start with. Or maybe I'm misinterpreting the language.\n\nLet me try rephrasing the problem in my own words.\n\nDave has 13 tickets. He spends some on toys and some on clothes. He used 8 tickets for toys and 18 tickets for clothes. The question is, how many more tickets did he use for clothes than for toys.\n\nBut again, that would be 18 - 8 = 10 tickets. However, the total tickets used would be 26, which is more than he has.\n\nThis doesn't make sense. Maybe the problem is trying to say that he used 8 tickets for toys and then 18 more tickets for clothes, but the total he has is 13 tickets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"18 more\" refers to something else.

So, the problem says: \"The ring toss game at the carnival made the same amount of money each day. In total, in 30 days, they earned $420. Together with another game, they earned $22 per day. How much did the ring toss game make per day?\"\n\nHmm, okay. First, I need to understand what's being asked. We need to find out how much money the ring toss game made each day. It says that it made the same amount every day for 30 days, totaling $420. But there's also mention of another game and them earning $22 together per day. This seems a bit confusing. Let's break it down.\n\nLet's define some variables to make sense of this. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( r \\) be the amount the ring toss game makes per day.\n\n- Let \\( g \\) be the amount the other game makes per day.\n\nAccording to the problem, together they earn $22 per day. So, that means:\n\n\\[ r + g = 22 \\]\n\nAlso, the ring toss game alone made $420 in 30 days. So, that means:\n\n\\[ 30r = 420 \\]\n\nWait a minute, is that correct? If \\( r \\) is the daily earnings of the ring toss game, then over 30 days, it would be \\( 30r = 420 \\). That seems straightforward.\n\nSo, I can solve for \\( r \\) from this equation:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{420}{30} \\]\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{420}{30} = 14 \\]\n\nSo, the ring toss game makes $14 per day.\n\nBut wait, there's another equation: \\( r + g = 22 \\). If \\( r = 14 \\), then:\n\n\\[ 14 + g = 22 \\]\n\n\\[ g = 22 - 14 = 8 \\]\n\nSo, the other game makes $8 per day. But the problem doesn't ask for the other game's earnings; it only asks for the ring toss game's daily earnings.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider? Let's see. The problem says, \"Together with game they earned $22 dollars..\" Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear, but it seems to mean that together, the ring toss game and another game earn $22 per day.\n\nBut according to my calculation, the ring toss game makes $14 per day, and the other game makes $8 per day, which adds up to $22. That seems consistent.\n\nAlso, the ring toss game alone made $420 in 30 days, which checks out because \\( 30 \\times 14 = 420 \\).\n\nI think that's the answer. However, let me double-check if there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total earnings from both games over 30 days is $420, and together they earn $22 per day. In that case, the total earnings over 30 days would be \\( 30 \\times 22 = 660 \\) dollars, which doesn't match the given $420. So, that can't be the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ring toss game earned $420 in 30 days, and together with the other game, they earn $22 per day. In that case, my initial approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to say that the ring toss game earned $420 in total, and together with the other game, they earn $22 per day. But that would mean the other game's earnings are needed to reach $22 per day, in addition to the ring toss game's earnings.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the total earnings from both games per day.\n\nLet's think differently. If the ring toss game earns \\( r \\) per day, and together with the other game they earn $22 per day, then indeed \\( r + g = 22 \\).\n\nBut the ring toss game alone earned $420 in 30 days, so \\( 30r = 420 \\), leading to \\( r = 14 \\) per day.\n\nThen, \\( g = 22 - 14 = 8 \\) per day.\n\nBut the problem seems to suggest that the ring toss game made $420 in 30 days, and together with the other game, they earn $22 per day.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"The ring toss game at the carnival made the same amount of money each day.

The question is asking how many more books he bought than he sold.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many books he sold. Let's call the number of books he sold \"s.\" So, starting with 71 books, after selling \"s\" books, he would have 71 - s books left.\n\nThen, he bought 38 new books, so he adds those to what he has left: (71 - s) + 38.\n\nAnd according to the problem, after all that, he has 116 books. So, I can set up an equation:\n\n71 - s + 38 = 116\n\nNow, I can simplify the left side:\n\n71 + 38 = 109, so:\n\n109 - s = 116\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if he had 109 books after buying 38, and then he has 116, that would mean he gained more books, but he sold some, which should decrease the number.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to rethink this.\n\nLet me try again. He starts with 71 books.\n\nHe sells some books, so he has 71 - s books.\n\nThen he buys 38 new books, so he has (71 - s) + 38 books.\n\nAnd this equals 116 books.\n\nSo, (71 - s) + 38 = 116\n\nLet me combine like terms:\n\n71 - s + 38 = 116\n\n71 + 38 = 109, so:\n\n109 - s = 116\n\nNow, to find s, I can subtract 109 from both sides:\n\n109 - s - 109 = 116 - 109\n\n-s = 7\n\nThen, multiply both sides by -1:\n\ns = -7\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.

Let\u2019s think about the net change in the number of books.\n\nHe started with 71 books and ended with 116 books. The difference is:\n\n116 - 71 = 45 books.\n\nThis means he gained 45 books in total from selling some and buying 38 new ones.\n\nBut, actually, when he sells books, he loses some books, and when he buys, he gains books.\n\nSo, the net gain is the number of books bought minus the number of books sold.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of books sold as s and the number bought as 38.\n\nSo, net gain = books bought - books sold = 38 - s\n\nAnd this net gain is equal to the total increase in books, which is 45.\n\nSo, 38 - s = 45\n\nNow, solve for s:\n\n38 - s = 45\n\nSubtract 38 from both sides:\n\n-s = 45 - 38\n\n-s = 7\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\ns = -7\n\nAgain, I get a negative number.

Suppose he sold s books and bought 38 books, and ended up with 116 books.\n\nStarting with 71 books, after selling s books, he has 71 - s books.\n\nThen, after buying 38 books, he has (71 - s) + 38 = 116\n\nSo, 71 - s + 38 = 116\n\nCombine 71 and 38: 71 + 38 = 109\n\nSo, 109 - s = 116\n\nNow, subtract 109 from both sides: -s = 7\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: s = -7\n\nStill getting a negative number.

Let me read it again.\n\n\"Matthew had 29 crackers and 30 cakes. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 2 friends. How many cakes did each person eat?\"\n\nHmm, this seems a bit unclear. It says he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 2 friends, but it doesn't specify if he divided them equally between the two friends or if each friend received the same number of crackers and cakes. Also, the last part about how many cakes each person ate is confusing because the previous statement only mentions giving them to his friends, not eating them.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let me consider that he gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each friend, meaning each friend received the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes.\n\nBut first, let's clarify: Matthew has 29 crackers and 30 cakes. He has 2 friends, and he wants to give them an equal number of crackers and cakes.\n\nSo, for crackers: He has 29 crackers to give to 2 friends equally. But 29 divided by 2 is 14.5. Since you can't really give half a cracker in some contexts, but maybe in this problem, fractional crackers are allowed.\n\nSimilarly, for cakes: He has 30 cakes to give to 2 friends equally. 30 divided by 2 is 15. So each friend gets 15 cakes.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 2 friends.\" Does that mean that the number of crackers each friend gets is equal to the number of cakes each friend gets? That would be different.\n\nLet me consider that interpretation.\n\nIf he gives an equal number of crackers and cakes to each friend, meaning that the number of crackers each friend gets is equal to the number of cakes each friend gets.\n\nSo, let's denote the number of crackers each friend gets as C and the number of cakes each friend gets as C (same as crackers).\n\nThen, total crackers given away would be 2C (since there are 2 friends), and total cakes given away would also be 2C.\n\nBut Matthew has 29 crackers and 30 cakes.\n\nSo, 2C \u2264 29 (for crackers)\n\nAnd 2C \u2264 30 (for cakes)\n\nThe maximum possible C would be the floor of 29/2, which is 14, since 2*14 = 28, which is less than or equal to 29.\n\nSimilarly, for cakes, 2*14 = 28 \u2264 30.\n\nSo, each friend gets 14 crackers and 14 cakes.\n\nBut then there would be 29 - 28 = 1 cracker left, and 30 - 28 = 2 cakes left.\n\nWhat does Matthew do with the remaining cracker and two cakes? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe we can ignore that for now.\n\nBut going back to the question: \"How many cakes did each person eat?\"\n\nThis is confusing because the problem only mentions giving cakes to his friends, not eating them. Maybe \"eat\" is a typo, and it's supposed to be \"each person got\" or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Matthew also eats some cakes, but that's not mentioned.\n\nLet me consider another approach.\n\nIf Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each of his 2 friends, then as above, each friend gets 14 crackers and 14 cakes.\n\nBut the question is about how many cakes each person ate, which is not provided in the information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"each person\" refers to Matthew and his 2 friends, making a total of 3 people.\n\nBut the problem says \"his 2 friends,\" so it's not clear if Matthew is included in the distribution.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to look at the problem differently.\n\nLet me consider that Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to each of his 2 friends, and perhaps he also kept some for himself, but the question is about how many cakes each person ate, which isn't specified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to his 2 friends in total, not per friend.\n\nBut that would mean the total crackers given to both friends are equal to the total cakes given to both friends.\n\nIn that case, let's denote the total crackers given away as C and the total cakes given away as C.\n\nSo, C \u2264", "answer": 15, "equiv": false}, {"output": "18", "answer": 18, "equiv": true}, {"output": "111", "answer": 111, "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": 7, "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": 6, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have packs of DVDs that normally cost 107 dollars each, but there's a discount of 106 dollars on each pack. I need to find out how many of these packs I can buy with 93 dollars.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the actual price of each pack is after the discount. The original price is 107 dollars, and there's a discount of 106 dollars on each pack. So, the discounted price per pack would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Discounted Price} = \\text{Original Price} - \\text{Discount} = 107 - 106 = 1 \\text{ dollar per pack} \\]\n\nWait a minute, that seems too good to be true. A 106-dollar discount on a 107-dollar item brings the price down to just 1 dollar per pack. Is that possible? Maybe there's a mistake in the problem or in my calculation. But according to the information given, that seems to be correct.\n\nSo, if each pack costs 1 dollar after the discount, and I have 93 dollars, then the number of packs I can buy should be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of Packs} = \\frac{\\text{Total Money}}{\\text{Discounted Price per Pack}} = \\frac{93}{1} = 93 \\]\n\nThat means I can buy 93 packs with 93 dollars if each pack costs only 1 dollar after the discount.\n\nBut let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"each pack of DVDs costs 107 dollars\" and \"there is a discount of 106 dollars on each pack.\" So, yes, the discounted price is indeed 1 dollar per pack.\n\nAnd I have 93 dollars to spend. So, dividing 93 by 1 gives 93 packs. That seems straightforward.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? Maybe tax or something, but the problem doesn't mention any additional costs. It seems like it's a straightforward calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider whether the discount applies per pack or in total. The problem says \"a discount of 106 dollars on each pack,\" which suggests that the discount applies to each pack individually. So, each pack is discounted by 106 dollars.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the discount is a total discount on the entire purchase, but that would likely be phrased differently. The problem specifies \"on each pack,\" so it's per pack.\n\nAnother way to look at it is whether the discount is applied once per pack or if it's a overall discount. But given the wording, it seems like the discount is per pack.\n\nSo, if I buy multiple packs, does the discount apply to each pack separately? For example, if I buy 2 packs, the total discount would be 106 * 2 = 212 dollars, which is more than the original total cost. That seems unusual, but according to the problem, that's how it's stated.\n\nWait a second, if I buy 2 packs, the original total cost would be 107 * 2 = 214 dollars, and the total discount would be 106 * 2 = 212 dollars. So, the total cost after discount would be 214 - 212 = 2 dollars for 2 packs.\n\nSimilarly, for 3 packs:\n\nOriginal total: 107 * 3 = 321 dollars\n\nTotal discount: 106 * 3 = 318 dollars\n\nTotal cost after discount: 321 - 318 = 3 dollars for 3 packs.\n\nWait, this pattern suggests that for n packs, the total cost after discount would be:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Cost} = (107n) - (106n) = n \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nSo, the cost per pack after discount is indeed 1 dollar per pack, as I initially calculated.\n\nTherefore, with 93 dollars, I can buy 93 packs.\n\nBut let's think about the practicality of this situation. A discount of 106 dollars on a 107-dollar item seems extremely high, effectively making each pack cost only 1 dollar. It's possible, maybe it's a clearance sale or something, but from a mathematical perspective, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAnother angle to consider: is there a limit on the number of packs I can buy? The problem doesn't specify any limitations, so I can assume that I can buy as many packs as my money allows, which is 93 packs.\n\nAlso, I should consider if there is any remainder or if I need to deal with fractions.

The key information is the daily production of grape drums and the number of days.\n\nFirst, I need to identify what's being asked. It's clearly asking for the total drums of grapes filled in 146 days. So, I need to find the product of the daily production of grape drums and the number of days.\n\nThe daily production of grape drums is 244, and the number of days is 146. So, the total drums of grapes would be 244 drums/day times 146 days.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal grape drums = 244 drums/day \u00d7 146 days\n\nNow, I just need to multiply these two numbers together.\n\nBefore I dive into the multiplication, I should make sure that I'm using the correct units. The units are drums per day and days, which, when multiplied, give drums. That makes sense.\n\nAlright, let's proceed with the multiplication.\n\nI can break this down to make it easier. I'll multiply 244 by 100, then by 40, and then by 6, and add those products together.\n\nFirst, 244 \u00d7 100 = 24,400\n\nNext, 244 \u00d7 40 = 9,760\n\nThen, 244 \u00d7 6 = 1,464\n\nNow, I'll add these amounts together:\n\n24,400 + 9,760 = 34,160\n\nThen, 34,160 + 1,464 = 35,624\n\nSo, the total number of drums of grapes filled in 146 days is 35,624.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method. Let's try the standard multiplication method.\n\n     244\n\n   \u00d7146\n\n   -------\n\n    1464  (244 \u00d7 6)\n\n   9760   (244 \u00d7 40, shifted one position to the left)\n\n  24400   (244 \u00d7 100, shifted two positions to the left)\n\n  -------\n\n  35624\n\nYes, that matches my earlier result. So, 35,624 drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other information in the problem that I might have missed.\n\nThe problem mentions that there are 294 pickers, and they fill 244 drums of grapes and 47 drums of raspberries per day. But looking at the question, it's only asking for the number of grape drums filled in 146 days. So, the number of pickers and the raspberries seem like extra information that isn't needed for this particular calculation.\n\nIt's possible that this is part of a larger problem, or maybe there's a reason for including that information, but based on the question asked, I think I can ignore those details.\n\nJust to be safe, let me see if the number of pickers or raspberries affects the calculation. If there are 294 pickers filling 244 drums of grapes per day, that's their combined effort. But since the problem gives the total drums per day, I don't need to worry about individual picker rates.\n\nSimilarly, the raspberries are mentioned, but since the question is only about grapes, I can disregard that information.\n\nTherefore, my calculation stands: 244 drums/day \u00d7 146 days = 35,624 drums.\n\nI should also consider if there's any need to simplify the answer further, but since it's a multiplication of whole numbers, 35,624 is the exact answer.\n\nLet me also think about whether there's any possibility of partial drums or something like that, but the problem talks about drums, which are whole containers, so it makes sense to have whole numbers.\n\nAdditionally, I should make sure that the units are correct. The question asks for the number of drums, and my answer is in drums, so that's good.\n\nOne more thing: the problem mentions \"they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day.\" The way it", "answer": 35624, "equiv": false}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": 8, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1891", "answer": 1891, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "17017", "answer": 17017, "equiv": true}, {"output": "58", "answer": 58, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. So, the problem says: \"4 birds and 46 storks were sitting on the fence. 6 more birds came to join them. How many birds are sitting on the fence?\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It seems like there are some birds and storks on a fence, and then more birds join them. The question is about finding out how many birds are on the fence after the new birds join.\n\nOkay, let's break it down.\n\nInitially, there are 4 birds and 46 storks on the fence. Then, 6 more birds come to join them. I need to find out the total number of birds on the fence after these 6 birds join.\n\nWait a minute, the problem mentions birds and storks separately. So, birds and storks are different types of birds, I suppose. But the question is about the total number of birds, not including storks.\n\nWait, but in common language, storks are also birds, but perhaps in this context, the problem is distinguishing between different types of birds.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for the number of birds sitting on the fence, not including storks. It mentions separately that there are 4 birds and 46 storks initially.\n\nSo, initially, there are 4 birds.\n\nThen, 6 more birds join them.\n\nSo, the total number of birds should be the initial 4 birds plus the 6 that joined.\n\nThat is, 4 + 6 = 10 birds.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions 4 birds and 46 storks initially. Then, 6 more birds join. So, the storks are already there, and only birds are joining.\n\nThe question is about the total number of birds on the fence, which would be the initial birds plus the ones that joined.\n\nSo, again, that's 4 + 6 = 10 birds.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is trying to mislead by mentioning storks, but since the question is only about birds, I shouldn't include storks in my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem considers storks as a separate category and only wants the number of birds, excluding storks.\n\nIn that case, indeed, only the birds should be considered.\n\nSo, initial birds: 4\n\nBirds that joined: 6\n\nTotal birds: 4 + 6 = 10\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the total number of all animals on the fence, including both birds and storks.\n\nLet me check the problem again.\n\nIt says: \"4 birds and 46 storks were sitting on the fence. 6 more birds came to join them. How many birds are sitting on the fence?\"\n\nThe question is specifically asking for the number of birds, not the total number of animals.\n\nSo, it should be only the birds.\n\nTherefore, initial birds: 4\n\nBirds that joined: 6\n\nTotal birds: 4 + 6 = 10\n\nBut let's think again. Maybe the storks are also considered birds, and the problem is trying to separate them for some reason.\n\nHowever, in biological classification, storks are birds, belonging to the class Aves.\n\nBut in the context of this problem, it seems to distinguish between birds and storks.\n\nPerhaps in this problem, \"birds\" refers to a specific type excluding storks.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the total number of birds, considering storks as a type of bird.\n\nIn that case, initial birds: 4\n\nInitial storks: 46\n\nBut storks are birds, so total birds initially: 4 + 46 = 50\n\nThen, 6 more birds join.\n\nSo, total birds: 50 + 6 = 56\n\nBut the problem separately mentions birds and storks, and then only talks about more birds joining.\n\nIt's a bit confusing.\n\nPerhaps the problem is considering storks separately from birds.\n\nIn that case, when calculating the number of birds, we should exclude storks.\n\nSo, initial birds: 4\n\nBirds that joined: 6\n\nTotal birds: 4 + 6 = 10\n\nAlternatively, if storks are included as birds, then initial birds: 4 + 46 = 50\n\nThen, 6 more birds join: 50 + 6 = 56\n\nI think the key is in the wording of the question.\n\nIt asks: \"How many birds are sitting on the fence?\"\n\nIt doesn't ask for the total number of animals, but specifically for birds.\n\nGiven that, and considering that storks are a type of bird, I think the problem likely intends for us to include storks in the total number of birds.\n\nTherefore, initial birds including storks: 4 + 46 = 50\n\nThen, 6 more birds join", "answer": 10, "equiv": false}, {"output": "21", "answer": 21, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nIn the morning, 41 campers went rowing and 4 campers went hiking. Then, in the afternoon, 26 campers went rowing. The question is asking how many campers went rowing and hiking in all.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"in all\" means here. I think it's asking for the total number of campers who went either rowing or hiking throughout the entire day.\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions campers going rowing in the morning and afternoon, and hiking only in the morning. So, there are campers who went rowing in the morning, hiking in the morning, and rowing in the afternoon.\n\nI need to find the total number of unique campers who went either rowing or hiking. It's possible that some campers went rowing in both the morning and afternoon, or only in the morning, etc. But the problem doesn't specify if there's any overlap between the groups.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider that campers could have participated in multiple activities or at different times. But the problem doesn't provide information about overlaps, so perhaps I should assume that all campers participated only in the activities mentioned without overlapping, unless specified otherwise.\n\nLet me list out the numbers:\n\n- Morning rowing: 41 campers\n\n- Morning hiking: 4 campers\n\n- Afternoon rowing: 26 campers\n\nI need to find the total number of campers who did either rowing or hiking.\n\nIf I add up all these numbers, I get 41 + 4 + 26 = 71 campers. But wait, is it possible that some campers are counted in more than one of these groups? For example, maybe some campers who went rowing in the morning also went rowing in the afternoon. If that's the case, then just adding these numbers would count those campers twice.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide information about whether there's any overlap between these groups. Maybe it's safe to assume that all campers participated only in the activities mentioned without any overlapping, unless stated otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the groups are distinct, meaning that no camper participated in more than one activity or at different times.\n\nIf that's the case, then the total number of campers would simply be the sum of the individual groups: 41 (morning rowing) + 4 (morning hiking) + 26 (afternoon rowing) = 71 campers.\n\nBut I should check if there's any possibility of overlapping groups. For example, could some campers have gone hiking in the morning and rowing in the afternoon? The problem doesn't say anything about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of campers is less than 71 because some campers are counted in more than one group.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the total number of campers is the sum of those who went rowing and those who went hiking, but subtracting those who did both.\n\nBut the problem doesn't give any information about campers who did both activities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's assuming that hiking and rowing are mutually exclusive activities in the morning, and rowing in the afternoon is separate.\n\nBut I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nTotal campers who went rowing is the sum of those who went in the morning and in the afternoon, which is 41 + 26 = 67 campers.\n\nAdditionally, 4 campers went hiking in the morning.\n\nAssuming that none of the hikers went rowing, then the total number of campers would be 67 (rowing) + 4 (hiking) = 71 campers.\n\nBut perhaps some of the hikers also went rowing in the afternoon. The problem doesn't specify.\n\nGiven the lack of information about overlaps, maybe the safest assumption is that all campers are distinct in each activity, leading to a total of 71 campers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to ask for the total number of campers who went rowing (both morning and afternoon) and those who went hiking (morning), without specifying overlaps.\n\nIn that case, the answer would still be 71.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the question again.\n\n\"41 campers went rowing and 4 campers went hiking in the morning. 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon. How many campers went rowing and hiking in all?\"\n\nThe way it's phrased, it seems like it's asking for the total number of campers who participated in either rowing or hiking during the day.\n\nGiven that, and without information on overlaps, the total would be the sum of all mentioned campers: 41 + 4 + 26 = 71.\n\n", "answer": 71, "equiv": false}, {"output": "34", "answer": 34, "equiv": true}, {"output": "58", "answer": 58, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the problem says there were originally 15 roses in the vase. Then, Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase. Wait a minute, but there were only 15 roses to begin with. That seems a bit off because she can't throw away more roses than there are in the vase. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps it's a typo. Let me double-check the problem.\n\nOkay, it says: \"There were 15 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 17 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she cut than those she threw away?\"\n\nHmm, this is confusing. If there were only 15 roses to start with, she can't throw away 33. Maybe it's supposed to be that she threw away 33 roses from somewhere else, not from the vase, but the problem says she threw away 33 roses from the vase. Perhaps it's a mistake, and it should be that she threw away 3 roses or something like that. But I'll proceed with the given numbers, assuming it's written correctly.\n\nSo, starting with 15 roses in the vase. She throws away 33 roses from the vase. That would mean the vase now has 15 - 33 = -18 roses. Wait, negative roses don't make sense. Maybe the problem means she threw away 33 roses from her garden or somewhere else, not from the vase. But it specifically says \"from the vase.\" This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"threw away 33 roses from the vase\" means she removed 33 roses from the vase and threw them away, but that would still leave a negative number of roses in the vase, which doesn't make sense. Unless, maybe, she owed someone roses or something. But that's probably not the case here.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe the problem meant that there were originally 15 roses in the vase, she threw away 33 roses from her garden, and then cut some more new roses to put in the vase, resulting in 17 roses in the vase now. In this case, the throwing away of 33 roses doesn't directly affect the number of roses in the vase, except for the new ones she adds.\n\nIf that's the case, then the number of roses she added is the number she cut from her garden. Let's say she cut x roses. So, starting with 15 roses, threw away 33 from her garden (which doesn't affect the vase directly), and then added x roses to the vase, resulting in 17 roses in the vase.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\n15 + x = 17\n\nSolving for x:\n\nx = 17 - 15\n\nx = 2\n\nSo, she cut 2 roses. Now, the problem asks how many more roses did she cut than those she threw away. She cut 2 roses and threw away 33 roses.\n\nSo, 2 - 33 = -31\n\nBut negative numbers don't make sense in this context, as you can't cut more roses than you threw away if you cut fewer. Maybe I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"There were 15 roses in the vase. Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. There are now 17 roses in the vase. How many more roses did she cut than those she threw away?\"\n\nThis still seems unclear because she can't throw away more roses than were in the vase. Unless, perhaps, she threw away 33 roses from the vase and then added new ones to end up with 17.\n\nWait, maybe the vase had more than 15 roses initially, and 15 were roses and the rest were other flowers. But the problem says \"15 roses in the vase.\" Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, and it should be that she threw away 3 roses, not 33. Let's try that.\n\nSo, starting with 15 roses, threw away 3 roses, leaving 12 roses in the vase. Then, she added some new roses to have 17 roses in the vase.\n\nSo, 12 + x = 17\n\nx = 5\n\nShe cut 5 roses. She threw away 3 roses.\n\nSo, how many more roses did she cut than those she threw away?\n\n5 - 3 = 2\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nBut the problem says 33, not 3. Maybe it's a typo.

And the question is, how many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many push-ups David did. Since David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, and Zachary did 15, I can add 39 to 15 to find David's push-ups.\n\nSo, David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 39 = 15 + 39.\n\nLet me do that calculation. 15 plus 39 is 54. So, David did 54 push-ups.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many push-ups John did. John did 9 less than David. So, John's push-ups = David's push-ups - 9 = 54 - 9.\n\n54 minus 9 is 45. So, John did 45 push-ups.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many more push-ups Zachary did than John. So, I need to find the difference between Zachary's and John's push-ups.\n\nZachary did 15, and John did 45. So, the difference is 15 - 45.\n\nWait a minute, that would be negative 30. But that doesn't make sense in this context because John did more push-ups than Zachary. The question is asking how many more push-ups Zachary did than John, which would be negative if John did more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the absolute difference. Let me re-read the question.\n\n\"How many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?\"\n\nIf John did more push-ups, then Zachary actually did fewer push-ups than John. So, the difference would be negative. But typically, when questions ask \"how many more did A do than B?\", and A did fewer, it's implying A did negative \"more\" push-ups, which means B did more.\n\nBut maybe I should think of it as the difference between their push-ups, regardless of who did more.\n\nWait, let's think carefully.\n\nIf A did more than B, then A - B is positive, indicating A did more push-ups.\n\nIf B did more than A, then A - B is negative, indicating A did fewer push-ups than B.\n\nSo, in this case, Zachary did 15, John did 45, so Zachary - John = 15 - 45 = -30.\n\nThis means John did 30 more push-ups than Zachary.\n\nBut the question is asking how many more push-ups Zachary did than John, which in this case is -30, meaning Zachary did 30 fewer push-ups than John.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the absolute difference, which is 30, but phrased in terms of Zachary doing more, which he didn't.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nLet me calculate the difference between Zachary and John's push-ups.\n\nZachary did 15, John did 45.\n\nSo, Zachary did 15 - 45 = -30 push-ups more than John.\n\nAlternatively, John did 45 - 15 = 30 more push-ups than Zachary.\n\nSo, Zachary did 30 fewer push-ups than John.\n\nBut the question is asking how many more push-ups Zachary did than John, which is -30, or simply, Zachary did 30 fewer push-ups than John.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the answer to be stated in terms of the absolute difference, acknowledging that Zachary actually did fewer.\n\nBut according to the wording, \"how many more push-ups did Zachary do than John?\", if Zachary did fewer, the difference is negative.\n\nHowever, in many contexts, when people ask \"how many more A did than B?\", and A actually did fewer, they might expect the answer to be that A did fewer by such amount, or that the difference is such amount, but with the understanding that B did more.\n\nPerhaps the best way is to calculate the difference and note that Zachary did fewer push-ups than John.\n\nBut let's see if there's another way to look at it.\n\nLet me consider the quantities:\n\nZachary: 15\n\nDavid: 54\n\nJohn: 45\n\nNow, Zachary did 15, John did 45.\n\nSo, Zachary did 15 - 45 = -30 more than John, which means John did 30 more than Zachary.\n\nAlternatively, the difference in push-ups between Zachary and John is |15 - 45", "answer": 30, "equiv": false}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have Ed and Doug, and they have marbles. The problem says that Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug initially. Then, Doug lost some marbles at the playground, and after that, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. We need to find out how many marbles Doug lost.\n\nFirst, let's try to understand what's going on. We have two people: Ed and Doug. Let's say Doug had some number of marbles to start with. Let's call that number D. Since Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, Ed had D + 2 marbles.\n\nNow, Doug lost some marbles at the playground. Let's say he lost M marbles. So, after losing M marbles, Doug has D - M marbles left.\n\nAt the same time, Ed's number of marbles hasn't changed because only Doug lost marbles. So, Ed still has D + 2 marbles.\n\nThe problem now says that after Doug lost M marbles, Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed's marbles are equal to Doug's marbles after the loss plus 19. In other words:\n\nEd's marbles = Doug's marbles after loss + 19\n\nWe can write this as an equation:\n\nD + 2 = (D - M) + 19\n\nNow, we need to solve for M, which is the number of marbles Doug lost.\n\nLet's simplify the equation:\n\nD + 2 = D - M + 19\n\nFirst, we can subtract D from both sides:\n\nD + 2 - D = D - M + 19 - D\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n2 = -M + 19\n\nNow, let's isolate M. We can subtract 19 from both sides:\n\n2 - 19 = -M\n\n-17 = -M\n\nNow, multiply both sides by -1 to solve for M:\n\n17 = M\n\nSo, Doug lost 17 marbles.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem to confirm.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the difference in the number of marbles between Ed and Doug before and after the loss.\n\nInitially, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug. So, the difference was 2 marbles.\n\nAfter Doug lost some marbles, the difference became 19 marbles.\n\nSo, the difference increased by 17 marbles because 19 - 2 = 17.\n\nThis means that Doug must have lost 17 marbles, which aligns with what I found earlier.\n\nLet me try to visualize this with some numbers to make sure.\n\nSuppose Doug initially had 20 marbles. Then Ed had 22 marbles (which is 2 more than Doug).\n\nIf Doug lost 17 marbles, he would have 20 - 17 = 3 marbles left.\n\nNow, Ed has 22 marbles, and Doug has 3 marbles. So, Ed has 22 - 3 = 19 more marbles than Doug, which matches the problem statement.\n\nAlright, this seems consistent.\n\nLet me try another set of numbers to confirm.\n\nSuppose Doug initially had 30 marbles. Then Ed had 32 marbles.\n\nIf Doug lost 17 marbles, he would have 30 - 17 = 13 marbles left.\n\nNow, Ed has 32 marbles, and Doug has 13 marbles. So, Ed has 32 - 13 = 19 more marbles than Doug again.\n\nThis seems to hold true regardless of the initial number of marbles Doug had.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that Doug lost 17 marbles.\n\nWait, but let's think about it again. Is there any other way this could be interpreted?\n\nThe problem says \"Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug.\" Then \"Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground.\" And finally, \"Now Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug.\"\n\nSo, the key here is that only Doug lost marbles, and Ed's number stayed the same.\n\nSo, the difference between their marbles increased from 2 to 19, which means Doug must have lost 17 marbles.\n\nAlternatively, if we think about it in terms of equations, we can set it up as I did earlier and solve for M.\n\nI don't see any other way to interpret this problem. It seems straightforward.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there was any possibility that Ed gained marbles or something, but the problem doesn't suggest that. It only says that Doug lost some marbles, implying that Ed's count remained the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that Doug lost", "answer": 17, "equiv": false}, {"output": "112", "answer": 112, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "140", "answer": 140, "equiv": true}, {"output": "102", "answer": 102, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

We have a certain number of baskets, each containing 4 red and 6 green peaches, and the total number of peaches is 10. I need to find out how many such baskets there are.\n\nLet me think about this. Each basket has 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches. So, the total number of peaches in each basket is 4 + 6 = 10 peaches.\n\nNow, if each basket has 10 peaches, and there are 10 peaches in total, then the number of baskets should be 10 divided by 10, which is 1.\n\nWait a minute, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. If there is only 1 basket, and it contains 4 red and 6 green peaches, that adds up to 10 peaches, which matches the total number of peaches given.\n\nBut the problem says \"distributed equally in some baskets,\" and \"some\" might imply more than one basket. Maybe I need to consider the possibility of multiple baskets.\n\nLet me consider if there could be more than one basket. Suppose there are 2 baskets. Each basket has 4 red and 6 green peaches, so each basket has 10 peaches. Then, 2 baskets would have 20 peaches in total, but the problem states there are only 10 peaches. So, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWhat if there is only 1 basket? Then, 1 basket contains 4 red and 6 green peaches, totaling 10 peaches. That matches the total number of peaches given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are fractions of baskets, but that doesn't make much sense in reality, as you can't have a fraction of a basket. Baskets are whole items.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the ratio of red to green peaches. Each basket has 4 red and 6 green peaches, which is a ratio of 4:6 or 2:3.\n\nIf there is only 1 basket, the ratio is 4:6, which simplifies to 2:3.\n\nIf there were 2 baskets, it would be 8 red and 12 green peaches, which is still 2:3, but the total number of peaches would be 20, which doesn't match the given total of 10.\n\nSimilarly, for half a basket, it would be 2 red and 3 green peaches, totaling 5 peaches, but again, that doesn't add up to 10.\n\nWait, maybe there are half baskets, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that each basket contains 4 red and 6 green peaches, but there are multiple baskets, and the total number of peaches is 10.\n\nBut if each basket has 10 peaches, and the total is 10, then only one basket makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"some baskets\" implies that the peaches are distributed equally among the baskets, meaning that each basket has the same number of peaches.\n\nGiven that, and each basket has 10 peaches, and the total is 10 peaches, then there can only be one basket.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that the peaches are distributed in baskets with some having 4 red and 6 green peaches, but possibly other baskets having different numbers, but the problem specifies that each basket has exactly 4 red and 6 green peaches.\n\nGiven that, it's consistent only if there is one basket.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement, and it should have different numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me into thinking that there are multiple baskets, but logically, only one basket fits the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that there is only one basket.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there is any other interpretation.\n\nSuppose that the baskets are not completely filled, meaning that some baskets have fewer peaches. But the problem states that the peaches are distributed equally in some baskets, and each basket has exactly 4 red and 6 green peaches.\n\nTherefore, each basket must have 10 peaches, and with a total of 10 peaches, there can only be one basket.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"some baskets\" refers to a partition of the peaches into groups of 10, but again, with only 10 peaches, there can only be one such group.\n\nTherefore, the logical conclusion is that there is only one basket", "answer": 1, "equiv": false}, {"output": "89", "answer": 89, "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": 6, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1080", "answer": 1080, "equiv": true}, {"output": "66", "answer": 66, "equiv": true}, {"output": "25740", "answer": 25740, "equiv": true}, {"output": "60", "answer": 60, "equiv": true}, {"output": "109044", "answer": 109044, "equiv": true}, {"output": "322", "answer": 322, "equiv": true}, {"output": "333", "answer": 333, "equiv": true}, {"output": "390", "answer": 390, "equiv": true}, {"output": "68", "answer": 68, "equiv": true}, {"output": "9", "answer": 9, "equiv": true}, {"output": "405", "answer": 405, "equiv": true}, {"output": "25", "answer": 25, "equiv": true}, {"output": "16", "answer": 16, "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": 8, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here. Lewis earns $491 every week during the harvest season, and the harvest season lasts for 1181 weeks. On top of that, he has to pay $216 in rent every week. The question is asking how much money he will have at the end of the harvest season after paying all his rent.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much money Lewis earns in total during the entire harvest season. Since he earns $491 each week and the season lasts for 1181 weeks, I can calculate his total earnings by multiplying his weekly earnings by the number of weeks.\n\nSo, total earnings = $491 * 1181 weeks.\n\nI should do that calculation carefully. Let's see:\n\n491 * 1181.\n\nHmm, multiplying 491 by 1000 gives 491,000.\n\nThen, 491 * 180 is, let's see, 491 * 100 = 49,100, and 491 * 80 = 39,280. So, 49,100 + 39,280 = 88,380.\n\nFinally, 491 * 1 = 491.\n\nNow, adding all those up: 491,000 + 88,380 + 491.\n\nLet's add 491,000 and 88,380 first: that's 579,380.\n\nThen, add 491: 579,380 + 491 = 579,871.\n\nSo, Lewis's total earnings are $579,871.\n\nNext, I need to calculate his total rent payments over the 1181 weeks. He pays $216 each week, so total rent = $216 * 1181 weeks.\n\nAgain, let's compute that step by step.\n\n216 * 1181.\n\n216 * 1000 = 216,000.\n\n216 * 180 = let's calculate that: 216 * 100 = 21,600, and 216 * 80 = 17,280. So, 21,600 + 17,280 = 38,880.\n\n216 * 1 = 216.\n\nNow, adding them up: 216,000 + 38,880 + 216.\n\nFirst, 216,000 + 38,880 = 254,880.\n\nThen, 254,880 + 216 = 255,096.\n\nSo, total rent payments are $255,096.\n\nNow, to find out how much money Lewis has at the end of the harvest season, I need to subtract his total rent payments from his total earnings.\n\nSo, money left = total earnings - total rent payments = $579,871 - $255,096.\n\nLet's do that subtraction.\n\n579,871 minus 255,096.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n1 - 6: can't do that, so I need to borrow. 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nNow, since I borrowed, it's 7 - 9: can't do that, so borrow again. 17 - 9 = 8.\n\nNext, since I borrowed, it's 8 - 0 = 8.\n\nThen, 9 - 5 = 4.\n\nAnd finally, 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nSo, 348,755.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that subtraction.\n\n579,871 - 255,096.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n1 - 6: can't do it, so borrow. 11 - 6 = 5.\n\nThen, 7 - 9: can't do it, so borrow. 17 - 9 = 8.\n\nNext, 8 - 0 = 8.\n\nThen, 9 - 5 = 4.\n\nAnd finally, 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nSo, yes, $348,755.\n\nWait a minute, but that doesn't match what I initially thought.

So, we have Paul who had some books and pens initially, then he sold some in a garage sale, and after that, he had a different number of books and pens left. The problem is asking how many pens he sold.\n\nFirst, let's make sure we understand what's given:\n\n- Initially, Paul had 51 books and 106 pens.\n\n- After the garage sale, he had 82 books and 14 pens left.\n\nWait a minute, that seems a bit confusing. If he had 51 books initially and after selling some he has 82 books left, that doesn't make sense because selling items should decrease the number he has, not increase it. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nLet me double-check the problem:\n\n\"Paul had 51 books and 106 pens. After selling some books and pens in a garage sale he had 82 books and 14 pens left.. How many pens did he sell in the garage sale?\"\n\nHmm, it indeed says he had 51 books initially and 82 books after the sale. That would mean he gained books, which is unusual for a sale. Maybe it's a typo, and it should be 51 books initially and fewer books after the sale. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that Paul had 82 books initially and sold some, ending up with 51 books. Similarly, maybe he had 106 pens initially and sold some, ending up with 14 pens. That would make more sense.\n\nSo, let's assume the problem meant:\n\n\"Paul had 82 books and 106 pens. After selling some books and pens in a garage sale, he had 51 books and 14 pens left. How many pens did he sell in the garage sale?\"\n\nThat seems more logical. So, initially:\n\n- Books: 82\n\n- Pens: 106\n\nAfter sale:\n\n- Books: 51\n\n- Pens: 14\n\nWe need to find out how many pens he sold.\n\nTo find out how many pens he sold, we can subtract the number of pens he has left from the initial number of pens.\n\nSo, pens sold = initial pens - pens left\n\nPens sold = 106 - 14\n\nPens sold = 92\n\nWait a second, but the problem as originally stated said he had 51 books and 106 pens initially, and after selling, he had 82 books and 14 pens left. If we follow that, then:\n\nPens sold = initial pens - pens left = 106 - 14 = 92\n\nBut that would mean he sold 92 pens. However, the initial interpretation was confusing because selling pens would typically reduce the number, but according to the original statement, books went from 51 to 82, which is an increase.\n\nMaybe there's a different interpretation. Perhaps Paul sold some items and also bought some new ones, which increased the number of books. But that complicates things, and the problem seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, and it should be that he had 82 books initially and 51 books after the sale, which would make sense.\n\nGiven that, if we assume the problem is correct as stated, then:\n\nPens sold = initial pens - pens left = 106 - 14 = 92\n\nBut I'm still puzzled by the books part. Maybe the problem is about pens only, and the books are irrelevant?\n\nWait, the problem mentions both books and pens, but it's only asking about pens. Maybe the books are just there to confuse us.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in copying the problem, and it should be that he had 82 books initially and 51 after the sale.\n\nAssuming that's the case, then:\n\nBooks sold = initial books - books left = 82 - 51 = 31\n\nBut again, the question is about pens, not books.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem is correctly stated, and the increase in books is due to something else, but for the pens, it's straightforward.\n\nSo, sticking to the original statement:\n\nInitial pens: 106\n\nPens left: 14\n\nPens sold: 106 - 14 = 92\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 92 pens sold.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's any other way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe the problem meant that Paul had 51 books and 106 pens initially, sold some, and then received some books as a gift, ending up with 82 books and 14 pens.\n\nIn that case, the pens part is still straightforward:", "answer": 92, "equiv": false}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "23", "answer": 23, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Danny collecting bottle caps and wrappers.

So, the total cost for the candy bars would be 99 times $3. That sounds like a lot of money.\n\nLet me calculate that. 99 times 3. Well, 100 times 3 is 300, so 99 times 3 would be 300 minus 3, which is 297. So, the total cost is $297.\n\nNow, Dan had $4 initially.

Let's consider that.\n\nIf the total cost for 99 candy bars is $3, then each one costs $3 divided by 99, which is $0.0303..., or 3 cents each.\n\nThat would make more sense with Dan having $4.\n\nSo, total cost is $3, and Dan has $4, so money left would be $4 - $3 = $1.\n\nBut the problem says \"99 candy bar for $3 each one costing the same amount of money.\"\n\nThis is confusing.

Perhaps David did fewer push-ups than Zachary.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that \"David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary\" means that Zachary did 56 less push-ups than David.\n\nSo, if David did 38 push-ups, then Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"more\" is used incorrectly, and it should be \"less.\" Let's assume that David did 56 less push-ups than Zachary, and David did 38 push-ups.\n\nThen, Zachary did David's push-ups plus 56, which is 38 + 56 = 94 push-ups.\n\nThen, the total push-ups done by both would be David's 38 plus Zachary's 94, which is 38 + 94.\n\nLet's calculate that: 38 + 94.\n\nFirst, 38 + 90 = 128, and 128 + 4 = 132.\n\nSo, the total would be 132 push-ups.\n\nBut wait, this goes back to my initial confusion because the problem clearly states that David did more push-ups than Zachary, but according to my calculation, Zachary did more.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the problem. Probably, it should be that Zachary did 56 more push-ups than David, and David did 38 push-ups.\n\nIn that case, Zachary did 38 + 56 = 94 push-ups, and together they did 38 + 94 = 132 push-ups.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem is correct as stated, then Zachary did 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups, which doesn't make sense, so the problem must have a typo.\n\nI'm going to assume that the problem meant Zachary did 56 more push-ups than David, and David did 38 push-ups.\n\nTherefore, Zachary did 38 + 56 = 94 push-ups.\n\nTotal push-ups: 38 + 94 = 132.\n\nSo, the answer should be 132.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider another approach.\n\nLet Z be the number of push-ups Zachary did.\n\nThen, David did Z + 56 push-ups.\n\nGiven that David did 38 push-ups,", "answer": 20, "equiv": false}, {"output": "Okay, so I've got this problem about Danny collecting bottle caps and wrappers. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\n\"Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers at the park. Now he has 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers in his collection. How many more wrappers than bottle caps does Danny have now?\"\n\nAlright, so it seems like Danny had some bottle caps and wrappers already, and then he found some more at the park. Now, he has a total of 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers. The question is asking how many more wrappers he has than bottle caps right now.\n\nWait a minute, the way the problem is phrased, it mentions that he found 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers at the park, but then it says he now has 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers in his collection. It doesn't ask about the difference between what he found and what he has; it directly states what he has now. So, I think I can directly use the current totals to find the difference between wrappers and bottle caps.\n\nSo, he has 43 wrappers and 27 bottle caps. To find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps he has, I need to subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of wrappers: 43\n\nNumber of bottle caps: 27\n\nDifference: 43 - 27\n\nNow, let's do the subtraction.\n\n43 minus 27.\n\nWell, 43 minus 20 is 23, and then 23 minus 7 is 16.\n\nSo, 43 - 27 = 16.\n\nTherefore, Danny has 16 more wrappers than bottle caps.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Maybe I should consider if there's any other information in the problem that I need to use.\n\nThe problem mentions that he found 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers at the park. But then it says \"now he has 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers in his collection.\" It seems like the amounts he found and what he has now are two separate pieces of information, and the question is only asking about the current totals.\n\nSo, I think I've got it right. He has 43 wrappers and 27 bottle caps, and the difference is 16.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should consider whether the amounts he found at the park relate to what he had before.\n\nLet me see. If he found 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers at the park, and now he has 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers, perhaps there's some relationship there, like maybe he had some bottle caps and wrappers before finding more.\n\nBut the problem says he \"found\" 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers at the park, and \"now\" he has 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers in his collection. It seems like the \"now\" refers to after finding those items, so perhaps the totals include what he found.\n\nWait, but if he found 10 bottle caps and now has 27, that would suggest he had 17 bottle caps before finding more, because 17 + 10 = 27. Similarly, if he found 62 wrappers and now has 43, that would suggest he had -19 wrappers before, which doesn't make sense because you can't have negative wrappers.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nLet me re-read the problem:\n\n\"Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers at the park. Now he has 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers in his collection.\"\n\nSo, it sounds like he found some items at the park and added them to his collection, resulting in a total of 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers.\n\nWait, but if he found 62 wrappers and now has 43, that suggests he might have removed some wrappers, which confuses me.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps he gave some away after adding what he found.\n\nBut given the information, I think the intention is that he found these items and added them to his collection, resulting in the current totals.\n\nSo, if he found 10 bottle caps and now has 27, that means he had 17 bottle caps before finding more.\n\nSimilarly, if he found 62 wrappers and now has 43, that would suggest he had -19 wrappers before, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests there might be an error in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he found 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers, but then lost some or gave some away,", "answer": 16, "equiv": false}, {"output": "14", "answer": 14, "equiv": true}, {"output": "42", "answer": 42, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let's see what it's asking.\n\nJessie weighed 114 kilograms initially. Then, she started jogging every day and lost some weight over two weeks. In the first week, she lost 50 kilograms, and in the second week, she lost 60 kilograms. The question is, how much does she weigh now?\n\nAlright, so I need to figure out her current weight after these two weeks of jogging and weight loss.\n\nFirst, I should probably start with her initial weight and subtract the weight she lost each week.\n\nSo, starting weight: 114 kilograms.\n\nAfter the first week, she lost 50 kilograms. So, her weight after the first week would be:\n\n114 kg - 50 kg = 64 kg.\n\nThen, in the second week, she lost another 60 kilograms. So, from her weight at the end of the first week, which was 64 kilograms, I need to subtract 60 kilograms.\n\n64 kg - 60 kg = 4 kg.\n\nWait, that seems really low.

After she started to go jogging every day, she lost 50 kilograms in the first week and 60 kilograms in the second week. How much does she weigh now?\"\n\nSo, yes, she started at 114 kg, lost 50 kg in the first week, and then another 60 kg in the second week.\n\nSo, total weight lost is 50 kg + 60 kg = 110 kg.\n\nThen, her current weight should be initial weight minus total weight lost:\n\n114 kg - 110 kg = 4 kg.\n\nBut again, that can't be right. People can't weigh 4 kilograms. That's like the weight of a small dog or something.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the problem itself. Perhaps the weights are in pounds instead of kilograms? Or maybe it's a typo in the amount of weight lost?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is hypothetical, and it's just about doing the math, regardless of whether the scenario makes real-world sense.\n\nBut from a practical standpoint, it's impossible for a person to lose that much weight in such a short period. The numbers seem off.\n\nAssuming it's just about practicing subtraction, then following the math, 114 - 50 - 60 equals 4 kilograms.\n\nSo, according to the math, she would weigh 4 kilograms.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense in reality. Maybe the problem is trying to teach the importance of checking the reasonableness of answers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means she lost 5 kilograms in the first week and 6 kilograms in the second week. That would make more sense.\n\nBut as it's written, it's 50 and 60 kilograms.\n\nWait, maybe it's a mistake in the units, and it should be kilograms instead of something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be 5 kilograms and 6 kilograms.\n\nIf that were the case, then 114 - 5 - 6 equals 103 kilograms, which is a reasonable weight.\n\nBut based on the problem as stated, I have to go with 4 kilograms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is stating that she lost 50 kilograms in total and 60 kilograms in the second week, which doesn't make sense because 60 is more than 50.\n\nWait, no, it says she lost 50 in the first week and 60 in the second week.\n\nUnless it's a typo and it's supposed to be 5 kilograms and 6 kilograms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the weights are in stones or something else.\n\nBut the problem specifies kilograms.\n\nGiven that, according to the math, it's 114 - 50 - 60 = 4 kilograms.\n\nSo, I guess the answer is 4 kilograms.\n\nBut I'm really skeptical about that.\n\nMaybe I should consider that she couldn't have lost that much weight in two weeks, so perhaps the problem has a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she started at 114 kilograms and lost 50 and then 60 kilograms, but that would imply she lost a total of 110 kilograms.\n\nAgain, 114 - 110 = 4 kilograms.\n\nBut like I said, that's not feasible for a human.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be 5 and 6 kilograms instead of 50 and 60.\n\nIf that's the case, then 114 - 5 - 6 = 103 kilograms.\n\nThat", "answer": 4, "equiv": false}, {"output": "20", "answer": 20, "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": 6, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1541", "answer": 1541, "equiv": true}, {"output": "19", "answer": 19, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "17", "answer": 17, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "14", "answer": 14, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": 10, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "149", "answer": 149, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "69", "answer": 69, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Okay, so I have this problem about Nell and her baseball cards.

Now she has 210 cards left. How many cards did Nell give to Jeff?\n\nAlright, so Nell started with 573 cards. She gave some to John and some to Jeff, and now she has 210 cards left. I need to find out how many she gave to Jeff.\n\nFirst, maybe I should figure out how many cards she gave away in total. She started with 573 and now has 210, so the total number of cards she gave away is 573 minus 210.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 573 - 210. That's 363 cards given away in total.\n\nNow, out of these 363 cards, she gave 195 to John. So, the rest must have gone to Jeff. So, to find out how many she gave to Jeff, I can subtract the number she gave to John from the total she gave away.\n\nSo, 363 - 195. Let me calculate that.\n\n363 minus 195. Hmm, 363 - 100 is 263, then 263 - 95. Wait, maybe it's easier to think of it as 363 - 200 would be 163, but I'm subtracting 195, which is 200 minus 5, so 163 + 5 is 168.\n\nWait, that seems confusing. Maybe I should just do it step by step.\n\nStarting with 363, subtract 195.\n\nFirst, subtract 100 from 363, which gives 263.\n\nThen subtract 90 from 263, which is 263 - 90. 263 - 90 is 173.\n\nFinally, subtract 5 from 173, which is 173 - 5 = 168.\n\nSo, she gave 168 cards to Jeff.\n\nWait a minute, let me check that again. Maybe there's a better way to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the total cards she had minus what she gave to John minus what she gave to Jeff equals what she has left.\n\nSo, 573 - 195 - x = 210, where x is the number of cards given to Jeff.\n\nFirst, 573 - 195 is 378.\n\nThen, 378 - x = 210.\n\nSo, x = 378 - 210 = 168.\n\nWait, that's the same answer I got before. So, it seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could set up an equation to represent the situation.\n\nLet\u2019s let j be the number of cards given to Jeff.\n\nThen, the total cards given away are 195 + j.\n\nAnd, the cards left are 573 - (195 + j) = 210.\n\nSo, 573 - 195 - j = 210.\n\nWait, no, that should be 573 - (195 + j) = 210.\n\nWhich simplifies to 573 - 195 - j = 210.\n\nThen, 573 - 195 = 378.\n\nSo, 378 - j = 210.\n\nTherefore, j = 378 - 210 = 168.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nMaybe I can approach it another way to confirm.\n\nTotal cards given away are 573 - 210 = 363.\n\nShe gave 195 to John, so to find what she gave to Jeff, it's 363 - 195.\n\nI already did that and got 168.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can add the cards given to John and Jeff and see if it equals the total given away.\n\n195 + 168 = 363.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if starting with 573, giving away 195 to John and 168 to Jeff, leaves her with 210.\n\nSo, 573 - 195 - 168.\n\nFirst, 573 - 195 = 378.\n\nThen, 37", "answer": 168, "equiv": false}, {"output": "481", "answer": 481, "equiv": true}, {"output": "14", "answer": 14, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this math problem here.

I need to find out how many peaches Jake has.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, it says Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. Since Steven has 19 peaches, I can find out how many Jake has by subtracting 12 from 19.\n\nSo, Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 12.\n\nThat would be 19 - 12 = 7.\n\nWait, but then it says Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill.

Maybe I should consider another approach.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, which is correct, but then Jake also has 72 more peaches than Jill.\n\nSo, Jake = Steven - 12 and Jake = Jill + 72.\n\nSince both expressions equal Jake, I can set them equal to each other.\n\nSo, Steven - 12 = Jill + 72.\n\nI know Steven has 19 peaches, so:\n\n19 - 12 = Jill + 72.\n\nThat simplifies to 7 = Jill + 72.\n\nThen, Jill = 7 - 72 = -65.\n\nAgain, I get a negative number for Jill's peaches, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread the problem.\n\nLet me look again.\n\n\"Steven has 19 peaches.

So, we have Jessie who currently weighs 27 kilograms, and she lost 101 kilograms after starting to jog every day. The question is, how much did she weigh before she started jogging?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. It seems like there's a bit of a mix-up with the numbers because if Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms and she lost 101 kilograms, that would suggest she weighed 27 + 101 = 128 kilograms before starting to jog. But let's double-check because the numbers seem a bit off\u2014losing 101 kilograms seems excessive for any person, but maybe it's a hypothetical scenario or a typo, but I'll proceed with the given numbers.\n\nSo, the key here is to find her original weight before the weight loss. Since she lost weight, we need to add the weight she lost to her current weight to find her original weight.\n\nLet's denote her original weight as \\( w \\).\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\n\\( w - 101 = 27 \\)\n\nTo find \\( w \\), we add 101 to both sides:\n\n\\( w = 27 + 101 \\)\n\nNow, let's do the math:\n\n27 + 100 = 127\n\n127 + 1 = 128\n\nSo, \\( w = 128 \\) kilograms.\n\nWait a minute, does this make sense? Losing 101 kilograms to reach 27 kilograms seems unrealistic for a person's weight loss scenario. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Perhaps it's supposed to be 11 kilograms instead of 101, which would make more sense.\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"Jessie currently weighs 27 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 101 kilograms. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?\"\n\nHmm, it does say 101 kilograms. Maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed with the given numbers.\n\nSo, based on the calculation, Jessie weighed 128 kilograms before starting to jog.\n\nBut let's consider the realism of the situation. A person weighing 128 kilograms losing 101 kilograms to reach 27 kilograms would put her in a potentially unhealthy weight range. The average adult female weight is around 70-75 kilograms, so 128 kilograms is already on the higher side, and 27 kilograms is extremely low.\n\nPerhaps the problem meant to say that Jessie gained weight after starting to jog, not lost. That would make more sense, but the problem clearly states \"lost 101 kilograms.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current weight is after the weight loss, so starting weight minus weight lost equals current weight.\n\nWait, that's what I used in my equation: starting weight - weight lost = current weight.\n\nSo, starting weight = current weight + weight lost.\n\nTherefore, 27 + 101 = 128 kilograms.\n\nBut again, considering the realism, this seems off. Maybe the weight lost is 10.1 kilograms instead of 101, which would make more sense.\n\nLet me consider if there's a decimal point missing. If she lost 10.1 kilograms, then starting weight would be 27 + 10.1 = 37.1 kilograms, which still seems low for an adult.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 11 kilograms lost, then 27 + 11 = 38 kilograms, which is still on the lower side.\n\nPerhaps the current weight is 27 kilograms, and she lost 101 grams, not kilograms. But that would be 27,000 grams - 101 grams = 26,899 grams, which is still 26.899 kilograms, not significantly different.\n\nThis makes me think that maybe the problem has a typo, and it should be different numbers, but since I have to work with what's given, I'll stick with 128 kilograms.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that in some countries, weight is measured in stones and pounds, but the problem uses kilograms, so perhaps it's intended to be taken literally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a mistake in the problem, and it should be that she gained 101 kilograms, not lost. In that case, starting weight + 101 = 27, so starting weight = 27 - 101 = -74 kilograms, which doesn't make sense because weight can't be negative.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense at all. So, that approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is stated incorrectly, and it should be that she lost weight to reach 27 kilograms, meaning her starting weight was higher, which align", "answer": 128, "equiv": false}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "67", "answer": 67, "equiv": true}, {"output": "68", "answer": 68, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "31", "answer": 31, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": 10, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's solve this problem step by step. So, the baker made 155 cakes in total. Then, his friend bought 140 cakes from him. We need to find out how many cakes the baker has left after this sale.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. The baker initially has 155 cakes, and he sells 140 of them to his friend. So, to find out how many cakes are left, I should subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes made.\n\nSo, the calculation should be:\n\nNumber of cakes left = Total cakes made - Cakes sold\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of cakes left = 155 - 140\n\nNow, let's do the subtraction.\n\n155 minus 140 is 15.\n\nSo, the baker has 15 cakes left.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Subtracting 140 from 155 should indeed give us 15. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that 140 is 15 less than 155. So, if you take 140 away from 155, you're left with 15.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of place values. 155 is composed of 1 hundred, 5 tens, and 5 ones. 140 is 1 hundred and 4 tens. Subtracting 140 from 155:\n\n- Hundreds: 1 - 1 = 0\n\n- Tens: 5 - 4 = 1\n\n- Ones: 5 - 0 = 5\n\nSo, combining that, it's 0 hundreds, 1 ten, and 5 ones, which is 15.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could use addition to check my subtraction. If the baker has 15 cakes left and his friend bought 140 cakes, then adding those together should give us the total number of cakes made.\n\nSo, 15 + 140 = 155, which matches the total cakes made. So, that confirms my answer is correct.\n\nAnother way to visualize this is to use a number line. Starting at 155, if you move 140 steps to the left, you land on 15. So, again, that confirms the answer.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other approach to this problem. Perhaps using equations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of cakes left as x.\n\nThen, according to the problem:\n\nTotal cakes made - Cakes sold = Cakes left\n\nSo, 155 - 140 = x\n\nTherefore, x = 15\n\nThat\u2019s straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use mental math, I could think of it as subtracting 100 from 155, which gives 55, and then subtracting the remaining 40 to get to 15.\n\nWait, subtracting 100 from 155 gives 55, and then subtracting 40 from 55 gives 15. Yes, that\u2019s another mental math strategy.\n\nAlternatively, I could break it down into smaller steps:\n\n- Subtract 100 from 155: 155 - 100 = 55\n\n- Then subtract 40 from 55: 55 - 40 = 15\n\nSo, again, it leads me to the same answer.\n\nI can also consider the problem in terms of money, just to see if it makes sense. Suppose each cake costs $1, and the baker made 155 cakes, so he has $155. Then, his friend buys 140 cakes, so he pays $140. The baker\u2019s remaining money would be $155 - $140 = $15, which corresponds to 15 cakes left.\n\nThat\u2019s another way to look at it.\n\nFurthermore, if I were to use compensation method for subtraction:\n\nStart with 155 - 140.\n\nI can think of 140 as 155 - 15, because 155 - 15 = 140.\n\nTherefore, 155 - 140 = 15.\n\nThat\u2019s a bit circular, but it still confirms the answer.\n\nAlternatively, I can add up from 140 to 155.\n\nStarting at 140, add 15 to get to 155.\n\nSo, 140 + 15 = 155.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 15, which is the number of cakes left.\n\nAll these different methods lead me to", "answer": 15, "equiv": false}, {"output": "8", "answer": 8, "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": 6, "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": 8, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": 7, "equiv": true}, {"output": "41", "answer": 41, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: during summer break, 819,058 kids from Lawrence County go to camp, and the other 668,278 kids stay home. I need to find out how many more kids spent their summer break at camp compared to those who stayed home.\n\nAlright, first things first, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's basically asking for the difference between the number of kids who went to camp and those who stayed home. So, I think I need to subtract the number of kids who stayed home from the number of kids who went to camp.\n\nSo, that would be:\n\n819,058 (kids who went to camp) - 668,278 (kids who stayed home) = ?\n\nOkay, let's do that subtraction. But before I jump into it, maybe I should make sure that I'm subtracting the smaller number from the larger one, since the problem is asking for \"how many more\" kids went to camp compared to those who stayed home. Yeah, that makes sense because \"how many more\" suggests a positive difference.\n\nSo, 819,058 - 668,278.\n\nLet me line up the numbers by their place values:\n\n```\n\n  819,058\n\n- 668,278\n\n__________\n\n```\n\nNow, I'll subtract starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n8 - 8 = 0\n\nNext, the tens place:\n\n5 - 7... hmm, 5 is less than 7, so I need to borrow from the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds place has a 0, so I need to borrow from the thousands place.\n\nThe thousands place has a 9, so I'll borrow 1 from there, making it 8, and the hundreds place becomes 10.\n\nNow, borrowing from the hundreds place, the tens place becomes 15.\n\nSo, 15 - 7 = 8\n\nNow, the hundreds place: 10 - 2 = 8\n\nThousands place: 8 - 8 = 0\n\nTen-thousands place: 1 - 6... wait, 1 is less than 6, so I need to borrow from the hundred-thousands place.\n\nThe hundred-thousands place is 8, and the ten-thousands place is 1.\n\nI borrow 1 from the hundred-thousands place, making it 7, and the ten-thousands place becomes 11.\n\nSo, 11 - 6 = 5\n\nHundred-thousands place: 7 - 6 = 1\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n```\n\n  819,058\n\n- 668,278\n\n__________\n\n  150,780\n\n```\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my subtraction again.\n\nLet me try subtracting again, step by step.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n8 - 8 = 0\n\n5 - 7: can't do that, so borrow from the hundreds place. Hundreds place is 0, so borrow from the thousands place, which is 9. Make it 8, and hundreds place becomes 10.\n\nNow, borrow from the hundreds place: hundreds place becomes 9, and tens place becomes 15.\n\nSo, 15 - 7 = 8\n\nHundreds place: 9 - 2 = 7\n\nThousands place: 8 - 8 = 0\n\nTen-thousands place: 1 - 6: can't do that, so borrow from the hundred-thousands place. Hundred-thousands place is 8, borrow 1, making it 7, and ten-thousands place becomes 11.\n\nSo, 11 - 6 = 5\n\nHundred-thousands place: 7 - 6 = 1\n\nSo, the difference is 150,780.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 150,780, but now I'm second-guessing myself. Maybe I should use a different method to verify.\n\nAlternatively, I could add the number of kids who went to camp and those who stayed home to find the total number of kids, but the problem doesn't ask for that. It's asking for the difference between the two groups.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use addition to check my subtraction. If I add the difference back to the number of kids who stayed home, I should get the number of kids who went to camp.\n\nSo, 668,278 + 150,780 = ?\n\nLet's add those:\n\n```\n\n  668,278\n\n+ 150,780\n\n__________\n\n  819,058\n\n", "answer": 150780, "equiv": false}, {"output": "54", "answer": 54, "equiv": true}, {"output": "16", "answer": 16, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1145", "answer": 1145, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

It also mentions 86 candies, but I'm not sure if the candies are related to the bags or not. The question is asking for the number of bags of cookies, but I already know I have 14 bags. Is there something I'm missing here?\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"You had 14 bags with equal number of cookies. If you had 28 cookies and 86 candies in total. How many bags of cookies do you have?\"\n\nHmm, it seems straightforward. I have 14 bags, each with an equal number of cookies, and overall, there are 28 cookies. So, to find out how many cookies are in each bag, I can divide the total number of cookies by the number of bags.\n\nSo, cookies per bag = total cookies / number of bags = 28 / 14 = 2 cookies per bag.\n\nBut the question is asking for the number of bags of cookies, which is already given as 14. Maybe the problem is trying to mislead me or something. Maybe I need to consider the candies as well.\n\nWait, the problem mentions 86 candies. Are the candies in the bags along with the cookies? The problem says \"14 bags with equal number of cookies,\" but it doesn't specify anything about candies being in the bags. Maybe the candies are separate.\n\nIf the candies are not in the bags, then the number of bags of cookies is still 14. But that seems too straightforward, and probably not what the problem is aiming for.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the bags contain both cookies and candies, and I need to figure out how many bags there are based on the total number of cookies and candies.\n\nBut the problem says \"14 bags with equal number of cookies,\" which suggests that each bag has the same number of cookies, and maybe different numbers of candies, or perhaps the candies are separate.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is trying to say that there are 14 bags in total, some containing cookies and some containing candies, and I need to find out how many bags contain cookies.\n\nBut that would make more sense. Let's assume that there are some bags with cookies and some with candies, and I need to find out how many bags have cookies.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet \\( b_c \\) be the number of bags with cookies.\n\nLet \\( b_{ca} \\) be the number of bags with candies.\n\nGiven that there are 14 bags in total:\n\n\\( b_c + b_{ca} = 14 \\)\n\nAlso, each bag with cookies has an equal number of cookies, and similarly for candies.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"14 bags with equal number of cookies,\" which suggests that all bags have the same number of cookies, but then it mentions candies separately.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe it's better to consider that each bag has the same number of cookies, and the total number of cookies is 28, as given.\n\nSo, if there are 14 bags, each with the same number of cookies, and total cookies are 28, then cookies per bag = 28 / 14 = 2.\n\nBut the question is asking for the number of bags of cookies, which seems to be 14, as stated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to say that some bags contain cookies and others contain candies, and I need to find out how many bags contain cookies, given the total number of cookies and candies.\n\nIf that's the case, then let's assume that each bag containing cookies has the same number of cookies, and each bag containing candies has the same number of candies.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- \\( b_c \\): number of bags with cookies.\n\n- \\( b_{ca} \\): number of bags with candies.\n\n- \\( c \\): number of cookies per cookie bag.\n\n- \\( d \\): number of candies per candy bag.\n\nGiven:\n\n\\( b_c + b_{ca} = 14 \\) (total bags)\n\n\\( b_c \\times c = 28 \\) (total cookies)\n\n\\( b_{ca} \\times d = 86 \\) (total candies)\n\nBut with these equations, there are too many variables. I need to see if there's a way to relate them.\n\nWait, the problem says \"14 bags with equal number of cookies.\" This might imply that all bags have the same number of cookies, but it doesn't specify about the candies.\n\nMaybe the bags all have the same number of cookies, and some may have candies as well, but that's", "answer": 2, "equiv": false}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "20", "answer": 20, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "365", "answer": 365, "equiv": true}, {"output": "27", "answer": 27, "equiv": true}, {"output": "19", "answer": 19, "equiv": true}, {"output": "11210", "answer": 11210, "equiv": true}, {"output": "720", "answer": 720, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "26", "answer": 26, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this math problem here: \"Baker made 133 cakes. If he sold 51 of them, how many more cakes did the baker make than those he sold?\" Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. The baker made a certain number of cakes, which is 133, and sold some of them, which is 51. The question is asking how many more cakes the baker made than those he sold. I think this means I need to find the difference between the number of cakes made and the number of cakes sold.\n\nSo, to find the difference, I should subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of cakes made. That is, 133 minus 51. Let me write that down:\n\n133 - 51\n\nNow, let's do the subtraction. Starting from the rightmost digit, 3 minus 1 is 2. Then, moving to the next digit, 3 minus 5 can't be done because 3 is smaller than 5. So, I need to borrow 1 from the hundreds place. The 1 in the hundreds place becomes 12 in the tens place, and the 3 in the tens place becomes 13. Now, 13 minus 5 is 8. Finally, in the hundreds place, it's 1 minus 0, which is 1.\n\nSo, 133 - 51 equals 82.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me check my subtraction again. Starting from the right:\n\n3 minus 1 is 2.\n\nThen, since 3 is less than 5, I borrow 1 from the hundreds place, making it 12 in the tens place and 13 in the tens place. But actually, it's the tens place that was 3, and after borrowing, it becomes 13, and the hundreds place becomes 1 (since 1 was borrowed from the hundreds place, which was originally 1 in 133, making it 0 hundreds and 13 tens).\n\nWait, I think I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet's write it out properly:\n\n133\n\n-51\n\n---\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n3 minus 1 is 2.\n\nNext, 3 minus 5. Since 3 is less than 5, I need to borrow from the hundreds place. The hundreds place is 1, so I borrow 1, making it 0 in the hundreds place, and the tens place becomes 13. Now, 13 minus 5 is 8.\n\nFinally, in the hundreds place, 0 minus 0 is 0.\n\nSo, the result is 82.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it in terms of total cakes made and cakes sold. The baker made 133 cakes and sold 51. So, the number of cakes he still has is 133 minus 51, which is 82.\n\nBut the question is asking for \"how many more cakes did the baker make than those he sold.\" This might be a bit tricky. Is it asking for the difference between the number made and the number sold, or is it asking how many more he made than he sold?\n\nI think it's the same as the difference between the number made and the number sold, which is 133 minus 51, which is 82.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for how many more cakes he made beyond what he sold. That would also be 133 minus 51, which is 82.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's asking for the total number of cakes made minus the number sold, which is again 82.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that \"how many more cakes did the baker make than those he sold\" is asking for the excess of cakes made over cakes sold, which is indeed the difference between the two numbers.\n\nSo, 133 minus 51 is 82.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a trick question, and I need to consider something else, but I don't think so. It seems straightforward.\n\nLet me consider another approach. If the baker made 133 cakes and sold 51, then the difference is 133 - 51 = 82.\n\nAlternatively, I could add up from 51 to 133 to see the difference.\n\nStarting from 51, add 82 to get to 133.\n\nWait, but that's the same as subtracting 51 from 133.\n\nSo, either way, the difference is 82.\n\nTherefore, the baker made 82 more cakes than he sold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of cakes remaining,", "answer": 82, "equiv": false}, {"output": "9", "answer": 9, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here.

I need to find out how much money she has left after her purchase.\n\nAlright, this seems like a straightforward subtraction problem. To find out how much money she has left, I just need to subtract the amount she spent from the initial amount she had.\n\nSo, it's 128 dollars minus 38 dollars.\n\nLet me write that down: 128 - 38.\n\nNow, let's do the subtraction.\n\nFirst, I'll subtract the units: 8 - 8 equals 0.\n\nNext, the tens: 2 - 3. Hmm, 2 is less than 3, so I need to borrow from the hundreds.\n\nLet's see, 128 is the same as 1 hundred, 2 tens, and 8 units.\n\nBut since I need to borrow, I'll make it 11 tens and 18 units.\n\nWait, no, borrowing works differently.\n\nActually, from 128, the 2 in the tens place is 2 tens, and the 1 in the hundreds place is 1 hundred.\n\nSo, to borrow, I'll reduce the hundreds by 1, making it 1 hundred become 10 tens, added to the 2 tens, making it 12 tens.\n\nThen, I can take one ten from the tens place, making it 11 tens, and add 10 units to the units place, making it 18 units.\n\nSo now, I have 1 hundred, 1 ten, and 18 units.\n\nNow, subtracting 38 from this.\n\nUnits: 18 - 8 = 10.\n\nTens: 1 - 3. Wait, still 1 is less than 3.\n\nHmm, maybe I messed up the borrowing.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nActually, perhaps it's easier to just do the subtraction directly.\n\n128\n\n-38\n\n------\n\nLet's subtract starting from the units.\n\n8 - 8 = 0.\n\nNow, for the tens place: 2 - 3.

It seems like they're asking how much more money is made from each jersey compared to each t-shirt. But let me read it again to make sure.\n\n\"The Razorback shop makes $115 off each jersey and $25 off each t-shirt... How much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt?\"\n\nWait a minute, it says \"how much more does a jersey cost than a t-shirt.\" Hmm, the way it's worded is a bit confusing because earlier it talks about how much money the shop makes off each item, not necessarily the cost of the items themselves.\n\nMaybe I need to clarify the difference between the shop's profit per item and the actual cost to the customer. The problem mentions how much the shop makes off each item, which is likely the profit per item. But the question is about how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, which would be the price difference between a jersey and a t-shirt.\n\nPerhaps there's some confusion in the wording. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking for the difference in the shop's profit between a jersey and a t-shirt.\n\nSo, if the shop makes $115 off each jersey and $25 off each t-shirt, then the difference in profit per item is $115 - $25.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n$115 - $25 = $90.\n\nSo, the shop makes $90 more off each jersey than off each t-shirt.\n\nBut the problem also provides information about the number of t-shirts and jerseys sold: 113 t-shirts and 78 jerseys. However, since the question is about how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, and not about total profits, this additional information might not be necessary for answering the question.\n\nWait, but if the problem is about the cost difference between a jersey and a t-shirt, then perhaps the profits per item are not directly related to the cost difference.\n\nLet me try to approach this differently.\n\nAssume that the shop makes $115 off each jersey, which likely means the selling price minus the cost price is $115. Similarly, for t-shirts, the shop makes $25 per t-shirt, meaning selling price minus cost price is $25.\n\nBut the question is about the cost difference between a jersey and a t-shirt, which would be the difference in their cost prices.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because if the shop makes a certain profit per item, and we don't know the cost prices or selling prices, it's hard to determine the cost difference directly from the profit per item.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is poorly worded, and what it really means is how much more profit does a jersey generate compared to a t-shirt.\n\nIn that case, the answer would simply be the difference in profit per item, which is $115 - $25 = $90.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nSuppose we denote:\n\n- Selling price of a jersey: P_j\n\n- Cost price of a jersey: C_j\n\n- Selling price of a t-shirt: P_t\n\n- Cost price of a t-shirt: C_t\n\nGiven that the shop makes $115 off each jersey: P_j - C_j = 115\n\nAnd makes $25 off each t-shirt: P_t - C_t = 25\n\nThe question is asking for how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, which would be C_j - C_t.\n\nBut from the given information, we only have the profit per item, not the cost prices directly. So, without additional information about either the selling prices or the cost prices, it's impossible to determine C_j - C_t directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem intended to ask how much more profit a jersey generates compared to a t-shirt, which would simply be $115 - $25 = $90.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the problem statement, I think the most straightforward interpretation is that it's asking for the difference in profit per item, which is $90.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be $90.\n\nBut to make sure, let's consider the total profits.\n\nTotal profit from jerseys: 78 * 115 = let's calculate that.\n\n78 * 100 = 7800\n\n78 * 15 = 1170\n\nTotal: 7800 + 1170 = 8970 dollars.\n\nTotal profit", "answer": 90, "equiv": false}, {"output": "9", "answer": 9, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this math problem here: \"If each pack costs 81 dollars, how much will it cost to buy 33 packs of DVDs?\" Okay, that seems straightforward.

But because it's actually 80, I need to add a zero at the end, making it 2640.\n\nSo, now I have:\n\n33\n\n\u00d7 81\n\n------\n\n33\n\n2640\n\n------\n\nNow, I need to add these two results together: 33 + 2640.\n\n33 + 2640 = 2673.\n\nSo, the total cost should be 2673 dollars.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, 33 \u00d7 1 = 33. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 33 \u00d7 80 = 2640. That also seems right.\n\nAdding them up: 33 + 2640 = 2673. Yeah, that looks correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of breaking down the numbers to make the multiplication easier.\n\nFor example, 81 is 80 + 1. So, 33 \u00d7 81 = 33 \u00d7 (80 + 1) = (33 \u00d7 80) + (33 \u00d7 1).\n\nWe already did that, and it gave us 2640 + 33 = 2673.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the distributive property.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the standard multiplication algorithm again to confirm.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, 81\n\n\u00d7 33\n\n------\n\nFirst, 1 \u00d7 33 = 33.\n\nThen, 80 \u00d7 33 = 2640.\n\nAgain, adding them up: 33 + 2640 = 2673.\n\nOkay, consistent result.\n\nAlternatively, I could multiply 81 by 30 and then add 81 times 3.\n\n81 \u00d7 30 = 2430.\n\n81 \u00d7 3 = 243.\n\nAdding them up: 2430 + 243 = 2673.\n\nAgain, the same answer.\n\nI think it's safe to say that the total cost is 2673 dollars.\n\nWait, the problem says \"packs of DVDs,\" but in the end, it's just asking for the total cost. So, I don't need to worry about how many DVDs are in each pack or anything like that. It's simply a multiplication problem.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can check one more time using a different method.\n\nLet's try the lattice method for multiplication.\n\nFor 33 \u00d7 81.\n\nFirst, I'll set up the lattice grid. Since both numbers are two digits, I'll need a 2x2 grid.\n\nWriting 33 on top and 81 on the side.\n\nMultiplying each digit:\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24.\n\n3 \u00d7 1 = 3.\n\n3 \u00d7 8 = 24.\n\n3 \u00d7 1 = 3.\n\nNow, adding along the diagonals:\n\nFrom the lattice, it should give me the same result.\n\nBut maybe I'll skip that for now, as it's a bit more time-consuming to write out, and I've already confirmed it with three different methods.\n\nI'm confident that 33 \u00d7 81 = 2673.\n\nTherefore, the total cost to buy ", "answer": 2673, "equiv": false}, {"output": "238", "answer": 238, "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": 10, "equiv": true}, {"output": "78", "answer": 78, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "38", "answer": 38, "equiv": true}, {"output": "308", "answer": 308, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Paul starts with a box of 440 crayons. That's his initial amount. Then, he gives away 111 crayons to his friends. And on top of that, he loses 106 crayons. I need to find out how many crayons he has left after these things happened.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of crayons that are no longer with Paul. That would be the sum of the crayons he gave away and the ones he lost. So, he gave away 111 and lost 106. Let's add those together: 111 plus 106.\n\nLet me do that addition. 111 plus 106. 1 plus 0 is 1, 1 plus 0 is 1, and 1 plus 1 is 2. So, 111 plus 106 equals 217 crayons that are no longer with Paul.\n\nNow, to find out how many crayons he has left, I need to subtract this total from his initial amount. So, he started with 440 crayons and no longer has 217 crayons. Therefore, 440 minus 217 should give me the number of crayons he has left.\n\nLet's do that subtraction. 440 minus 217. Starting from the right, 0 minus 7. Well, you can't subtract 7 from 0, so I need to borrow from the tens place. The tens place has 4, so borrowing 1 from there makes it 3, and the 0 becomes 10. Now, 10 minus 7 is 3.\n\nNext, the tens place: 3 minus 1 is 2.\n\nThen, the hundreds place: 4 minus 2 is 2.\n\nSo, 440 minus 217 equals 223.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that subtraction. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nStarting again: 440 minus 217.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- 0 minus 7: can't do that, so borrow 1 from the tens place. The 4 in the tens place becomes 3, and the 0 becomes 10. Then, 10 minus 7 is 3.\n\n- Now, the tens place: 3 minus 1 is 2.\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 minus 2 is 2.\n\nSo, 223 seems correct. But let me verify by adding 217 plus 223 to see if I get back to 440.\n\n217 plus 223: 7 plus 3 is 10, write down 0 and carry over 1. Then, 1 plus 2 plus 2 is 5. And finally, 2 plus 2 is 4. So, 217 plus 223 equals 440, which matches the initial amount. Okay, that checks out.\n\nTherefore, Paul has 223 crayons left.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe by subtracting the crayons given away and lost separately from the initial amount.\n\nSo, starting with 440 crayons:\n\nFirst, he gives away 111 crayons: 440 minus 111.\n\nLet's calculate that: 440 minus 111. 0 minus 1: can't do it, so borrow 1 from the tens place. The tens place has 4, becomes 3, and the 0 becomes 10. Then, 10 minus 1 is 9.\n\nNext, the tens place: 3 minus 1 is 2.\n\nHundreds place: 4 minus 1 is 3.\n\nSo, 440 minus 111 equals 329 crayons remaining after giving some away.\n\nThen, he loses 106 crayons. So, 329 minus 106.\n\nSubtracting 106 from 329: 9 minus 6 is 3, 2 minus 0 is 2, and 3 minus 1 is 2.\n\nSo, 329 minus 106 equals 223.\n\nAgain, I get 223 crayons left.\n\nThis matches my previous calculation, so I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, I could have added the crayons given away and lost, and then subtracted that total from the initial amount, which is what I did first, and it also gave me 223.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same result, confirming that 2", "answer": 223, "equiv": false}, {"output": "53", "answer": 53, "equiv": true}, {"output": "153", "answer": 153, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about someone who needs wax to stick feathers together. He has 557 grams of wax in total, and right now he just needs 17 grams. The question is asking how many grams of wax the feathers require in total.\n\nHmm, let's see. So, he has 557 grams of wax, and he needs to use 17 grams for something right now. I think the problem is asking for the total amount of wax required for all the feathers, but he only needs 17 grams at the moment.\n\nWait a minute, the way the problem is phrased is a bit confusing. It says, \"he has 557 g of wax and right now he just needs 17 g. Total how many grams of wax do the feathers require?\"\n\nI think what it's asking is, if he has 557 grams of wax and he needs to use 17 grams for the current task, how much wax will be required in total for the feathers? Or maybe it's asking how much wax will be left after using 17 grams from the 557 grams he has.\n\nBut looking again, it seems to be asking for the total wax required for the feathers, not how much will be left.\n\nLet me read it again: \"he has 557 g of wax and right now he just needs 17 g. Total how many grams of wax do the feathers require?\"\n\nMaybe it's a subtraction problem. He has 557 grams and he needs to use 17 grams, so the total required would be 557 - 17.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make much sense because if he has 557 grams and needs to use 17 grams, the total required would still be 557 grams, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he has 557 grams of wax, and he needs 17 grams for one feather, and the problem is asking how much wax is required in total for all the feathers.\n\nBut then I need to know how many feathers there are, which isn't provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nIf he has 557 grams of wax and needs to use 17 grams for something, maybe the total wax required for the feathers is just 17 grams, and he has extra wax.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward, and probably not what the problem is getting at.\n\nLet me consider the sentence structure again: \"he has 557 g of wax and right now he just needs 17 g. Total how many grams of wax do the feathers require?\"\n\nIt seems like he has 557 grams, and he's going to use 17 grams now, and the question is how much wax is required in total for the feathers.\n\nMaybe the total requirement is the amount he has plus the amount he needs to use.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If he has 557 grams and needs to use 17 grams, the total required wouldn't be the sum of those two amounts.\n\nPerhaps the problem is trying to say that he has 557 grams of wax, and for each feather, he needs 17 grams, and we need to find out how much wax is required in total for all the feathers.\n\nBut again, that would require knowing how many feathers there are, which isn't provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a division problem: with 557 grams of wax, how many feathers can he make if each feather requires 17 grams.\n\nBut the question is asking for the total grams required for the feathers, not how many feathers he can make.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's try rephrasing the question.\n\n\"He has 557 g of wax and right now he just needs 17 g.

If he had 36 crackers, how many friends did he give crackers to?\" Okay, let's try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. Matthew has 36 crackers, and he gives 6 crackers to each friend. I need to find out how many friends he gave crackers to. It seems like a division problem because I'm trying to see how many groups of 6 crackers I can make from 36 crackers.\n\nSo, division is probably the way to go. If I divide the total number of crackers by the number of crackers per friend, I should get the number of friends. That is, 36 divided by 6.\n\nLet me write that down: 36 \u00f7 6.\n\nNow, I know that 6 times what number equals 36? Because division is the inverse of multiplication. So, 6 multiplied by something equals 36. Let's see, 6 times 6 is 36. So, 36 divided by 6 should be 6.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? If Matthew has 36 crackers and gives 6 to each friend, and he has 6 friends, then 6 friends times 6 crackers per friend equals 36 crackers. That checks out.\n\nBut let me double-check. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using multiplication or subtraction?\n\nWell, if I use multiplication, I could set it up as 6 friends times 6 crackers equals 36 crackers, which matches the total number of crackers Matthew had. So, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about subtracting 6 crackers for each friend until I reach zero. So, starting with 36 crackers:\n\n- First friend: 36 - 6 = 30\n\n- Second friend: 30 - 6 = 24\n\n- Third friend: 24 - 6 = 18\n\n- Fourth friend: 18 - 6 = 12\n\n- Fifth friend: 12 - 6 = 6\n\n- Sixth friend: 6 - 6 = 0\n\nYes, that gives me 6 friends again. So, both methods lead to the same answer.\n\nIs there a possibility that there could be fewer or more friends? Well, if I had fewer friends, say 5, then 5 friends times 6 crackers would be 30 crackers, but Matthew had 36 crackers. That means there would be 6 crackers left over, which doesn't make sense because the problem says he gave crackers to his friends, implying he gave away all his crackers.\n\nWait, does it say he gave away all his crackers? Let's check the problem again: \"Matthew gave 6 crackers to each his friends. If he had 36 crackers. How many friends did he give crackers to?\"\n\nIt doesn't explicitly say he gave away all his crackers, but the way it's phrased suggests that he distributed all 36 crackers to his friends, giving each friend 6 crackers.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe there's a possibility that he didn't give away all his crackers. Maybe he had some left over. However, in standard division problems like this, we assume that the division is exact, meaning there's no remainder.\n\nIn this case, 36 divided by 6 is exactly 6, with no remainder. So, there's no issue there.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each friend receives 6 crackers, and Matthew has 36 crackers in total. So, the number of friends is the total crackers divided by the crackers per friend.\n\nSo, number of friends = total crackers / crackers per friend = 36 / 6 = 6.\n\nThis seems straightforward. But to make sure I'm not missing anything, let's consider units. If crackers are being divided into groups of 6 per friend, then the units work out because crackers divided by crackers per friend gives the number of friends.\n\nNo unit issues there.\n\nAlso, it's important to consider if there could be a fractional number of friends. But since friends are whole people, you can't have a fraction of a friend. So, the number of friends must be a whole number, which in this case it is: 6.\n\nIs there any other mathematical operation I could use here? Maybe addition or something else, but division seems most appropriate for this scenario.\n\nLet me also consider if Matthew gave 6 crackers to each friend and had 36 crackers, could there be a scenario where he gave crackers to more or fewer friends?\n\nWell, if he gave 6 crackers to each friend and had 36 crackers, he can only give to 6 friends fully.

It says that during summer break, 610769 kids from Lawrence County go to camp, and the other 590796 kids stay home. Also, 22 kids from outside the county attended the camp. The question is asking for about how many kids are in Lawrence County.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what the question is asking. It wants to know the approximate number of kids in Lawrence County. The information given is about how many kids go to camp and how many stay home, both from Lawrence County, and also that some kids from outside the county attended the camp.\n\nSo, the total number of kids in Lawrence County would be the sum of those who go to camp and those who stay home, right? Because those are the two groups that make up the county's kids.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal kids in Lawrence County = kids who go to camp + kids who stay home\n\nSo, that would be 610769 + 590796.\n\nBut the problem also mentions that 22 kids from outside the county attended the camp. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky. Does that affect the total number of kids in Lawrence County? I don't think so, because those 22 kids are from outside the county. So, they aren't part of the Lawrence County kid population.\n\nSo, I think I can ignore those 22 kids for the purpose of finding the total number of kids in Lawrence County. The question is only about the kids in Lawrence County, not about the total number of kids at the camp.\n\nLet me double-check that. The problem says \"610769 kids from Lawrence County go to camp and the other 590796 kids stay home.\" So, it's clearly distinguishing between kids from Lawrence County who go to camp and those who stay home.\n\nThen it says \"an additional 22 kids from outside the county attended the camp.\" This is extra information, but it doesn't affect the total number of kids in Lawrence County. It just tells me that there are some external kids attending the camp.\n\nSo, my calculation should just be the sum of the two groups from Lawrence County:\n\n610769 + 590796.\n\nNow, let's add those numbers together.\n\n610769\n\nPlus\n\n590796\n\nLet's see, starting from the units place:\n\n9 + 6 = 15, carry over 1.\n\n6 + 9 = 15, plus 1 is 16, carry over 1.\n\n7 + 0 = 7, plus 1 is 8.\n\n0 + 7 = 7.\n\n1 + 9 = 10, carry over 1.\n\n6 + 5 = 11, plus 1 is 12, carry over 1.\n\nFinally, 6 + 5 = 11, plus 1 is 12.\n\nSo, the total is 1,201,565.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"about how many kids are in Lawrence County.\" It's asking for an approximate number, so maybe I don't need to be so precise.\n\nPerhaps I can round the numbers before adding them to make it simpler.\n\nLet's try rounding each number to the nearest thousand.\n\n610769 rounded to the nearest thousand is 611,000.\n\n590796 rounded to the nearest thousand is 591,000.\n\nNow, add those together:\n\n611,000 + 591,000 = 1,202,000.\n\nThat's close to the exact sum I calculated earlier, which was 1,201,565.\n\nSo, rounding to the nearest thousand gives me 1,202,000, which is a good approximation.\n\nAlternatively, if I round to the nearest ten thousand, 610769 is about 610,000, and 590796 is about 590,000. Adding those gives 1,200,000.\n\nBut rounding to the nearest thousand gives a more precise approximation, which is 1,202,000.\n\nI think that's acceptable for the purpose of this problem.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions \"about,\" so maybe rounding to the nearest ten thousand would be sufficient, giving 1,200,000.\n\nLet me see which one makes more sense.\n\nIf I round both numbers to the nearest thousand:\n\n610769 \u2192 611,000\n\n590796 \u2192 591,000\n\nSum = 1,20", "answer": 1201565, "equiv": false}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "22", "answer": 22, "equiv": true}, {"output": "76138", "answer": 458988, "equiv": false}, {"output": "89", "answer": 89, "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": 10, "equiv": true}, {"output": "14", "answer": 14, "equiv": true}, {"output": "26", "answer": 26, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this math problem here, and I need to find out how many apples Jake has.

Then reading is 11 pages.\n\nThe question is asking for how many more pages of reading homework than biology homework Rachel had.\n\nSo, biology is 15 pages, reading is 11 pages. Actually, in this case, reading has fewer pages than biology, not more.\n\nBut the problem says \"how many more pages of reading homework than biology homework did she have?\" So, if reading has 11 pages and biology has 15 pages, then reading has 11 - 15 = -4 pages more than biology. But negative doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework, 11 pages of reading homework, and 8 more pages of biology homework. How many more pages of reading homework than biology homework did she have?\"\n\nNow, perhaps the way it's phrased, \"8 more pages of biology homework,\" means that biology has 8 pages, in addition to something else. But that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a typo, and it should have said \"biology homework was 8 pages,\" for example.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I should look at the structure of the sentence.\n\nIt says, \"7 pages of math homework, 11 pages of reading homework, and 8 more pages of biology homework.\"\n\nThis could be interpreted as:\n\n- Math: 7 pages\n\n- Reading: 11 pages\n\n- Biology: 8 pages more than reading, which would be 11 + 8 = 19 pages.\n\nBut if that's the case, then reading has 11 pages and biology has 19 pages, so reading has 11 - 19 = -8 more pages than biology, which again doesn't make sense in the context.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"8 more pages of biology homework\" means that biology has 8 pages, in addition to the reading homework pages. So biology would be 11 + 8 = 19 pages.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent with the way the sentence is structured.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a mistake in the problem statement, and it should have specified that biology has 8 more pages than math, or than reading.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should consider that biology has 8 pages, and compare that to reading's 11 pages.\n\nSo, biology: 8 pages, reading: 11 pages.\n\nThen, reading has 11 - 8 = 3 more pages than biology.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward, and maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that biology has 8 more pages than math, which is 7 pages, so biology is 7 + 8 = 15 pages.\n\nThen, reading is 11 pages.\n\nSo, reading has 11 - 15 = -4 more pages than biology, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for how many more pages of reading than biology, regardless of the sign.\n\nBut in that case, it would still be 4 pages less, but the problem says", "answer": 3, "equiv": false}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "42", "answer": 42, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this math problem here: \"The school has 4 grades and each grade has 75 students. How many students were there in total?\" Okay, let's see. I need to find the total number of students in the school.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. There are 4 grades in the school, and each grade has 75 students. So, to find the total number of students, I should add the number of students in each grade together. Since each grade has the same number of students, which is 75, I can add 75 four times.\n\nSo, that would be 75 + 75 + 75 + 75. Let me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, add the first two grades: 75 + 75 = 150.\n\nThen, add the third grade: 150 + 75 = 225.\n\nFinally, add the fourth grade: 225 + 75 = 300.\n\nSo, the total number of students is 300.\n\nWait a minute, is there a faster way to do this? I remember that addition can be slow if there are many numbers, so maybe multiplication would be better. Since each grade has 75 students and there are 4 grades, I can multiply 75 by 4.\n\nLet me try that: 75 multiplied by 4.\n\nI know that 70 times 4 is 280, and 5 times 4 is 20. So, 280 + 20 equals 300.\n\nThat matches what I got from adding them up. So, the total number of students is 300.\n\nBut the problem says \"The school has 304 grades...\" Wait, that can't be right. 304 grades? That seems too many for a school. Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be 4 grades. Otherwise, it wouldn't make much sense.\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"The school has 304 grades and each grade has 75 students. How many students were there in total?\"\n\nHmm, that does say 304 grades. That seems unusual for a school, but maybe it's a different type of school or perhaps it's a typo. But I'll proceed with the numbers given.\n\nSo, if there are 304 grades and each grade has 75 students, then the total number of students would be 304 multiplied by 75.\n\nOkay, let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, I can break it down. I know that 300 grades would have 300 times 75 students, and 4 grades would have 4 times 75 students. Then I can add those two results together.\n\nSo, 300 times 75.\n\nI know that 3 times 75 is 225, so 300 times 75 would be 22,500.\n\nNext, 4 times 75 is 300, as I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, add those two together: 22,500 plus 300 equals 22,800.\n\nTherefore, the total number of students is 22,800.\n\nBut wait, is there another way to verify this? Maybe I can use a different method to make sure I get the same answer.\n\nAnother way is to multiply 75 by 304 directly.\n\nI can break down 304 into 300 + 4, so 75 times 300 is 22,500, and 75 times 4 is 300. Adding those gives 22,800. That matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of 304 as 300 + 4 and use the distributive property: 75 times 304 equals 75 times 300 plus 75 times 4.\n\nWhich is again 22,500 plus 300, equaling 22,800.\n\nSo, no matter how I look at it, the total number of students should be 22,800.\n\nBut honestly, the idea of a school having 304 grades seems off. Maybe it's a typo and it's supposed to be 4 grades, which would make more sense for a school. In that case, the total would be 300 students, as I calculated earlier.\n\nHowever, since the problem specifically says 304 grades, I'll go with the higher number.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider whether 304 grades make sense. Maybe it's a very large school", "answer": 22800, "equiv": false}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here. Let's see what it's asking. There's a cave that's 1218 feet deep, and they're already at 849 feet. They're traveling at a speed of 17 feet per what? Per minute, per hour? Wait, it doesn't specify. That's a bit tricky. I guess I need to assume it's feet per minute since 17 feet per hour would be very slow for traveling through a cave.\n\nAlright, so if they're already at 849 feet and the cave is 1218 feet deep, I need to find out how much farther they have to go to reach the end of the cave.\n\nFirst, I should find the remaining distance. That would be the total depth minus the current depth they're at.\n\nSo, remaining distance = total depth - current depth\n\nThat is, remaining distance = 1218 feet - 849 feet\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n1218 - 849 = 369 feet\n\nSo, they have 369 feet left to reach the end of the cave.\n\nBut the problem also mentions that they are traveling at a speed of 17 feet per minute. I'm not sure if I need to calculate the time it will take to cover that remaining distance or just the distance itself.\n\nLooking back at the problem, it says, \"How much farther until they reach the end of the cave?\" It seems like it's asking for the remaining distance, which I've already calculated as 369 feet.\n\nBut maybe it's asking for the time it will take to cover that remaining distance at the given speed. Let's see.\n\nIf it's asking how much farther in terms of distance, then the answer is 369 feet. If it's asking how much longer in terms of time, then I need to divide the remaining distance by the speed.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"How much farther until they reach the end of the cave?\" The word \"farther\" suggests distance, so I think the answer should be in feet.\n\nHowever, perhaps the \"they\" refers to people traveling through the cave, and \"farther\" could be interpreted as time. But I think distance is more straightforward in this context.\n\nTo be safe, I'll check if the speed unit is specified. The speed is given as 17, but without units. It's probably feet per minute, as I initially thought.\n\nSo, if they're traveling at 17 feet per minute, and they have 369 feet left to travel, the time it would take is time = distance / speed.\n\nTime = 369 feet / 17 feet per minute.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n369 \u00f7 17 \u2248 21.7059 minutes.\n\nBut again, the question seems to be asking for distance, not time.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the speed is irrelevant to the question, and the answer is simply the remaining distance.\n\nI'm a bit confused now. Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"The cave is 1218 feet deep and they are already at 849 feet. If they are traveling at speed of 17. How much farther until they reach the end of the cave?\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the speed is included to throw me off, and the question is indeed only about the remaining distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking for the remaining distance in terms of time, but it's worded poorly.\n\nGiven that, I'll consider both possibilities.\n\nFirst, the remaining distance is 369 feet, as calculated earlier.\n\nSecond, the time to cover that distance at 17 feet per minute is approximately 21.7059 minutes.\n\nBut since the question seems to be asking for \"how much farther,\" which likely refers to distance, I think the answer should be 369 feet.\n\nMoreover, if the speed were in feet per second or another unit, it would have specified, so assuming it's feet per minute, my calculation for time seems reasonable, but perhaps not required.\n\nTo be extra sure, let's consider the units.\n\nIf the speed is 17 feet per minute, then time = distance / speed = 369 feet / 17 feet per minute = 21.7059 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if the speed is 17 feet per second, then time = 369 / 17 \u2248 21.7059 seconds, which would be unusually fast for traveling through a cave.\n\nGiven that, feet per minute is more plausible.\n\nBut again, the question might simply be asking for the remaining distance, in which case, 369 feet is the answer.\n\nI think I should stick with the initial interpretation: the answer is the remaining distance, which is 369 feet.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{36", "answer": 369, "equiv": false}, {"output": "12", "answer": 12, "equiv": true}, {"output": "32", "answer": 32, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

Hmm, okay. So, let's try to understand the sequence of days here.\n\nLet's assume that today is the day Rachel visited, which had 92 visitors. Yesterday had 419 visitors, and the day before yesterday had 103 visitors. Now, the problem is asking for the number of visitors before that day, which I think refers to the day before the day before yesterday.

Let's call that day \"three days ago.\"\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't provide the number of visitors for three days ago. It only gives the numbers for today, yesterday, and the day before yesterday. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"before that day\" refers to the cumulative total of visitors before the day with 103 visitors.\n\nWait, let's read the problem again carefully: \"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 92 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that. How many visited the Buckingham palace before that day?\"\n\nSo, it seems like:\n\n- Today: 92 visitors\n\n- Yesterday: 419 visitors\n\n- Day before yesterday: 103 visitors\n\nAnd \"before that day\" likely means before the day before yesterday, which would be three days ago and earlier.\n\nBut the problem doesn't provide any information about the number of visitors before that. It only gives the numbers for the last three days. Maybe the problem is asking for the total number of visitors before the day with 103 visitors.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a trick question, and it's asking for the total number of visitors before the day with 103 visitors, which would be the sum of visitors before that day.\n\nBut again, we don't have any information about previous days. Maybe the problem is expecting us to calculate the total visitors over the days mentioned and then subtract to find the before that day's visitors.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose the problem is saying:\n\n- Today (day 1): 92 visitors\n\n- Yesterday (day 2): 419 visitors\n\n- Day before yesterday (day 3): 103 visitors\n\nAnd \"before that day\" refers to before day 3, which would be day 4 and before.\n\nBut again, without information about those days, we can't determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"that day\" refers to today, and \"before that day\" means yesterday and earlier.\n\nBut that still doesn't help because we don't have information about days before yesterday.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about cumulative visitors.

Maybe \"that day\" refers to the day before yesterday, and \"before that day\" refers to days prior to the day before yesterday.\n\nBut without numbers for those days, I can't compute anything.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Maybe it's asking for the total number of visitors before the day with 103 visitors, assuming that's the earliest day mentioned.\n\nIn that case, if day 1 is today with 92 visitors, day 2 is yesterday with 419 visitors, and day 3 is day before yesterday with 103 visitors, then \"before that day\" would be before day 3, which has no data provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"that day\" is today, and \"before that day\" is yesterday and earlier.\n\nBut again, without more information, I can't proceed.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about a sequence", "answer": 522, "equiv": false}, {"output": "566", "answer": 566, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this problem here: Matthew had 22 crackers and 34 cakes.

Matthew has 22 crackers and 34 cakes, and he's giving some of these to his 11 friends. The key point is that he gives equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend. So, each friend gets the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes.\n\nBut the question is about how many crackers each person ate. Now, this is a bit confusing because it says \"each person ate,\" but it doesn't specify if Matthew is included in these \"persons\" or not. Typically, in such problems, if it's about distributing to friends, it might not include Matthew himself. But to be sure, I need to consider both possibilities.\n\nLet me first assume that Matthew is not included in the \"11 friends.\" So, he's distributing the crackers and cakes to his 11 friends, and we need to find out how many crackers each friend got.\n\nGiven that, we can start by dividing the crackers among the 11 friends equally.\n\nTotal crackers = 22\n\nNumber of friends = 11\n\nSo, crackers per friend = 22 / 11 = 2\n\nSimilarly, for cakes:\n\nTotal cakes = 34\n\nNumber of friends = 11\n\nCakes per friend = 34 / 11\n\nWait a minute, 34 divided by 11 is not a whole number. 11 times 3 is 33, which is less than 34, and 11 times 4 is 44, which is more than 34.

Perhaps he gave each friend a certain number of crackers and a certain number of cakes, but the number of crackers and cakes per friend is different.\n\nBut the problem says \"equal numbers of crackers and cakes\" to each friend.

If all buses are full, how many seats are in each bus?\"\n\nYes, the number of classrooms is probably just additional information that isn't needed for this particular problem.\n\nSo, with 46 buses and 92 students, if all buses are full, then each bus must have \\( \\frac{92}{46} = 2 \\) seats.\n\nBut, does this make sense in a real-world scenario? Typically, school buses have many more seats than 2. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of students is supposed to be larger. But according to the problem, there are 92 students and 46 buses.\n\nLet me consider if maybe the number of buses is supposed to be fewer, but according to the problem, it's 46 buses.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the problem means that each bus has the same number of seats, and all seats are filled with students, so the total number of seats across all buses equals the total number of students.\n\nSo, again, that would be \\( \\text{number of buses} \\times \\text{seats per bus} = \\text{total students} \\)\n\nPlugging in the numbers: \\( 46 \\times s = 92 \\)\n\nSolving for \\( s \\): \\( s = \\frac{92}{46} = 2 \\)\n\nSo, each bus has 2 seats.\n\nBut, realistically, school buses have around 10 to 100 seats, depending on the type of bus.

Maybe I can round each number to make the addition easier. Let's see.\n\nFirst, looking at 907,611. If I round this to the nearest thousand, it would be 908,000. That's because the hundreds digit is 6, which is 5 or above, so I round up.\n\nNext, 455,682. If I round this to the nearest thousand, it would be 456,000.

How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It seems like they're asking how much more money is made from each t-shirt compared to each jersey. But let's make sure.\n\nThe shop makes $210 off each jersey and $240 off each t-shirt. So, the difference in revenue per item is what they're asking for, right? That would be the difference between $240 and $210.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n$240 (t-shirt) - $210 (jersey) = $30.\n\nSo, a t-shirt costs $30 more than a jersey in terms of revenue per item.\n\nBut wait, the problem also provides numbers about how many were sold: 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys. Do I need to use these numbers?\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?\"\n\nHmm, the problem is about revenue, but it's asking about how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey. Wait, there's a confusion here.\n\nActually, the problem says \"how much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey.\" But earlier, it mentions that the shop makes $210 off each jersey and $240 off each t-shirt. So, is \"cost\" referring to the profit per item?\n\nI think there might be a misunderstanding. Let's clarify the terms.\n\nIf the shop makes $210 off each jersey, does that mean the profit per jersey is $210? Similarly, $240 per t-shirt?\n\nIf that's the case, then the difference in profit per item is $30, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut the problem uses the word \"cost,\" which typically refers to the expense. However, in this context, it might be referring to the revenue or profit per item.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking about the difference in the selling price of a t-shirt and a jersey.\n\nLet me consider that possibility.\n\nIf the shop makes $210 off each jersey, that could mean the selling price minus the cost equals $210. Similarly for t-shirts.\n\nBut to find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, I need to find the difference in their selling prices.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. If \"cost\" refers to the price the shop charges, then it's about the selling price.\n\nBut typically, \"cost\" refers to the expense incurred to produce or acquire the item.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem.\n\nLet's look at the problem again:\n\n\"The Razorback shop makes $210 off each jersey and $240 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys. How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?\"\n\nFirst, \"the shop makes $210 off each jersey\" \u2014 this likely means the profit per jersey is $210.\n\nSimilarly, \" $240 off each t-shirt\" \u2014 profit per t-shirt is $240.\n\nThen, they sold 177 t-shirts and 23 jerseys.\n\nBut the question is \"how much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?\"\n\nIf \"cost\" refers to the selling price, then I need to find the selling price of a t-shirt minus the selling price of a jersey.\n\nBut to find that, I need to know the cost price and the profit.\n\nWait, perhaps I can assume that the profit per item is the selling price minus the cost price.\n\nSo, for jerseys:\n\nSelling price - cost price = $210.\n\nSimilarly, for t-shirts:\n\nSelling price - cost price = $240.\n\nBut I don't have the cost prices, and I don't have the selling prices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that the shop sells jerseys for $210 each and t-shirts for $240 each.\n\nIn that case, the selling price of a t-shirt is $240, and the selling price of a jersey is $210.\n\nTherefore, a t-shirt costs $30 more than a jersey.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that $210 and $240 were the profits, not the selling prices.\n\nThis confusion is making it hard to proceed.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the context.

The grasshopper jumped 19 inches, which is 4 inches farther than the frog. And the mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog. I need to find out how far the frog jumped.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, I know the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, and that's 4 inches farther than the frog. So, if the frog jumped some distance, and the grasshopper jumped 4 inches more than that, then the frog must have jumped less than 19 inches.\n\nLet me try to express this mathematically. Let's say the frog jumped x inches. Then, the grasshopper jumped x + 4 inches, and that's equal to 19 inches. So, I can set up the equation:\n\nx + 4 = 19\n\nNow, to find x, I need to subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 19 - 4\n\nx = 15\n\nSo, the frog jumped 15 inches.\n\nBut wait, let's check if this makes sense with the other part of the problem. The mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog. If the frog jumped 15 inches, then the mouse jumped 15 - 44 inches. That would be negative 29 inches, which doesn't make sense because a jump can't be negative.\n\nHmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I set up the equation wrong.\n\nLet me read the problem again. \"The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog.\" So, if the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, and that's 4 inches more than the frog, then the frog must have jumped 19 - 4 = 15 inches.\n\nBut then the mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog, which would be 15 - 44 = -29 inches, which is impossible.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I misread the problem. Let me look again.\n\n\"The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog.\"\n\nHmm, maybe it's ambiguous. Let me see if it's written clearly.\n\nIt says, \"The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog.\"\n\nPerhaps it's meant to be interpreted as two separate pieces of information:\n\n1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.\n\n2. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog.\n\n3. The mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog.\n\nSo, from 1 and 2:\n\nGrasshopper's jump = frog's jump + 4 inches\n\n19 = frog + 4\n\nSo, frog = 19 - 4 = 15 inches.\n\nThen, mouse = frog - 44 = 15 - 44 = -29 inches, which is impossible.\n\nWait, maybe the units are off. Inches are a valid measurement, so that's not the issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the frog can't jump less than 44 inches, but that doesn't make sense because 15 is less than 44.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is misphrased, and it's meant to be that the mouse jumped 44 inches less than the grasshopper, not the frog.\n\nLet me check the problem again.\n\n\"No, it says, 'the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog.'\"\n\nSo, according to the problem, mouse = frog - 44.\n\nBut if frog = 15, then mouse = -29, which is impossible.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem itself.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the mouse couldn't have jumped a negative distance, so there's no solution.\n\nBut that seems unlikely; probably, I misread the problem.\n\nWait, maybe it's \"the mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog jumped,\" but if the frog jumped 15 inches, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's meant to be that the mouse jumped 44 inches less than the grasshopper.\n\nWait, no, it says \"the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog.\"\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"lesser\" is a typo, and it should be \"less.\"\n\nAssuming it's \"less,\" then mouse = frog - 44.\n\nBut then, as before, if frog = 15, mouse = -29, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"lesser", "answer": 15, "equiv": false}, {"output": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step.

It seems like some bird families are migrating away for the winter, and I need to find out how many in total are flying away.\n\nLet's see. There are 18 bird families near the mountain to start with. Then, 38 flew away to Africa and 80 to Asia. But wait, the question is about how many bird families flew away for the winter, and it mentions that there are 18 near the mountain, but it doesn't specify if these 18 are part of the ones flying away or not.\n\nActually, re-reading the problem, it says there are 18 bird families living near the mountain, and then separately, 38 flew away to Africa and 80 to Asia. So, it seems like the 18 are the ones near the mountain, and the 38 and 80 are additional families flying away to Africa and Asia, respectively.\n\nBut, maybe I should consider whether the 18 near the mountain are included in the 38 going to Africa or the 80 going to Asia. The wording suggests that the 18 are distinct from the ones flying away, because it says \"if 38 bird families flew away to Africa and 80 bird families flew away to Asia.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the total number of bird families that flew away is just the sum of those going to Africa and those going to Asia, which would be 38 plus 80.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal bird families flew away = bird families to Africa + bird families to Asia\n\nSo, Total = 38 + 80\n\nAdding those together, 38 plus 80 is 118.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem mentions that there are 18 bird families living near the mountain. Is that relevant to the calculation, or is it just additional information?\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"There are 18 bird families living near the mountain. If 38 bird families flew away to Africa and 80 bird families flew away to Asia. How many bird families flew away for the winter?\"\n\nIt seems like the 18 bird families near the mountain are not the ones flying away, because it says \"if 38 bird families flew away to Africa and 80 bird families flew away to Asia.\" So, perhaps the 18 are staying behind, and we're supposed to find out how many left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 18 includes some of those that flew away, but based on the wording, it appears that the 38 and 80 are in addition to the 18.\n\nBut to be honest, the wording is a bit confusing. Maybe I should consider that the total number of bird families is 18, and out of them, 38 flew to Africa and 80 to Asia, which doesn't make sense because 38 plus 80 is already 118, which is more than 18.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that there are 18 bird families near the mountain, and in addition to them, 38 flew to Africa and 80 to Asia, and the question is how many flew away in total.\n\nIn that case, the total number that flew away would indeed be 38 plus 80, which is 118, and the 18 near the mountain are not flying away.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 18 includes some of those that flew away, but that seems unlikely given the wording.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 18 is the total number of bird families, and 38 flew to Africa and 80 to Asia, which would not make sense because 38 plus 80 is already more than 18.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that there are 18 bird families near the mountain, and some of them flew away to Africa and some to Asia, and I need to find out how many flew away in total.\n\nBut then, it says \"38 bird families flew away to Africa and 80 bird families flew away to Asia.\" But 38 plus 80 is 118, which is much larger than 18, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are supposed to be interpreted differently. Maybe the 38 and 80 are percentages or something, but no, the problem states \"bird families,\" so they should be numbers of families.\n\nWait, maybe it's a typo, and it", "answer": 118, "equiv": false}, {"output": "6", "answer": 6, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 1, "equiv": false}, {"output": "So I have this math problem here. It says that there are 87 bird families living near a mountain, and then 18 new bird families joined them. I need to find out how many bird families live near the mountain now.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I think this is a straightforward addition problem. I have an initial number of bird families, which is 87, and then I have 18 more joining them. So, to find the total number of bird families now, I just need to add these two numbers together.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal bird families = initial bird families + new bird families\n\nSo, total bird families = 87 + 18\n\nNow, I need to add 87 and 18. I can do this in my head, but maybe I should show the steps for clarity.\n\nFirst, I can add 10 to 87, which would give me 97. Then, I add the remaining 8 from 18 to 97, which should give me 105.\n\nWait a minute, does that make sense? Let me check that again.\n\n87 plus 10 is 97, and then 97 plus 8 is indeed 105. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could break it down further. I can add the tens and the ones separately.\n\n87 has 8 tens and 7 ones.\n\n18 has 1 ten and 8 ones.\n\nSo, adding the tens: 8 tens + 1 ten = 9 tens, which is 90.\n\nAdding the ones: 7 ones + 8 ones = 15 ones.\n\nNow, 15 ones is the same as 1 ten and 5 ones.\n\nSo, I need to add that extra ten to the tens place.\n\nSo, 90 + 10 = 100, and then add the remaining 5 ones, which gives me 105.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nLet me try adding it another way to confirm.\n\nI can use the column method. Let's write 87 and 18 one above the other.\n\n```\n\n  87\n\n+ 18\n\n---\n\n```\n\nStarting from the right, 7 plus 8 is 15. I write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nThen, 8 plus 1 is 9, plus the carried over 1 makes it 10.\n\nSo, I write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again.\n\nActually, in the tens place, I have 8 tens plus 1 ten, which is 9 tens, plus the carried over 1 makes it 10 tens, which is 100.\n\nSo, combining that with the 5 from the ones place, it's 105.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculations.\n\nJust to be thorough, I can use a different approach, like subtracting from the total.\n\nIf I have 105 bird families now, and 18 joined, then 105 minus 18 should give me the initial number, which is 87.\n\nLet me check: 105 - 18.\n\n105 minus 10 is 95, minus 8 is 87. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I subtract 18 from 105, I should get back to 87.\n\nSo, 105 - 18:\n\n```\n\n 105\n\n- 18\n\n---\n\n```\n\n5 minus 8 can't be done, so I borrow 1 from the tens place.\n\nThat makes it 15 minus 8 is 7, and the tens place is 9 minus 1 is 8, but wait, no.\n\nWait, 105 is 10 tens and 5 ones.\n\nSubtracting 18, which is 1 ten and 8 ones.\n\nSo, 10 tens minus 1 ten is 9 tens, and 5 ones minus 8 ones needs borrowing.\n\nSo, borrow 1 ten, which is 10 ones, plus the 5 ones make 15 ones.\n\nThen, 15 ones minus 8 ones is 7 ones.\n\nAnd 9 tens minus 1 ten (because we borrowed) is 8 tens.\n\nSo, 8 tens and 7 ones is 87.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use rounding.\n\nLet's round 18 to 20. 20 is easier to add.\n\nSo, 87 plus 20 is 107.\n\nBut since I added 2 extra (because 18 is 2 less than 20), I need", "answer": 105, "equiv": false}, {"output": "32", "answer": 32, "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": 7, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "27", "answer": 27, "equiv": true}, {"output": "737", "answer": 737, "equiv": true}, {"output": "8265", "answer": 8265, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "14", "answer": 14, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So Randy has 58 blocks in total.

It's straightforward: I need to find the total number of blocks used for both the tower and the house. So, I should add the number of blocks used for the tower and the number of blocks used for the house.\n\nSo, blocks used for the tower are 27, and blocks used for the house are 53. Adding these together should give me the total blocks used.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal blocks used = blocks for tower + blocks for house\n\nTotal blocks used = 27 + 53\n\nNow, let's add those numbers:\n\n27 + 53\n\n20 + 50 = 70\n\n7 + 3 = 10\n\nSo, 70 + 10 = 80\n\nTherefore, Randy used 80 blocks in total for both the tower and the house.\n\nBut wait a minute, Randy only had 58 blocks to start with.

Is there a mistake in the problem, or am I misunderstanding something?\n\nMaybe the problem is trying to say that he uses 27 blocks for the tower and then 53 blocks for the house, but perhaps he can't use more blocks than he has.

Let me try to think differently.\n\nIf Randy has 58 blocks and uses 27 for the tower, then the number of blocks left would be:\n\n58 - 27 = 31 blocks remaining.\n\nThen, if he uses 53 blocks for the house, but he only has 31 blocks left, that doesn't make sense because 53 is more than 31.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem, or maybe I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Maybe the problem is saying that he uses 27 blocks for the tower and 53 blocks for the house, and I need to find the total used, regardless of how many blocks he has.\n\nIn that case, the total used would still be 27 + 53 = 80 blocks.\n\nBut the problem mentions that he has 58 blocks, which is less than 80. So, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me or there's additional information I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to find out how many blocks he used in total for both, without considering whether he had enough or not.\n\nBut that seems unlikely. Maybe I should just stick to the initial interpretation: he used 27 blocks for the tower and 53 for the house, so total used is 80 blocks.\n\nHowever, since he only has 58 blocks, perhaps he couldn't actually use 53 blocks for the house after using 27 for the tower.\n\nMaybe the problem is poorly worded, or maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem in my own words: Randy has 58 blocks. He uses some to build a tower and some to build a house. He used 27 blocks for the tower and 53 blocks for the house. The question is, how many blocks did he use in total for both?\n\nSo, 27 + 53 = 80 blocks used in total.\n\nBut again, he only has 58 blocks, so perhaps the problem is trying to find out how many blocks he would need in total, regardless of how many he has.\n\nIn that case, the answer is still 80 blocks.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking how many blocks he used before running out of blocks.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the problem clearly states he uses 27 and 53 blocks for the tower and house,", "answer": 80, "equiv": false}, {"output": "24", "answer": 24, "equiv": true}, {"output": "146", "answer": 146, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here about Danny collecting bottle caps and wrappers.

Let's read it step by step.\n\nDave had 11 apps and 3 files on his phone. After deleting some apps and files, he had 24 files and 2 apps left. The question is, how many more files than apps does he have left on the phone?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It seems like Dave started with some apps and files, deleted some, and ended up with 2 apps and 24 files. The question is asking for the difference between the number of files and apps he has left.\n\nSo, if he has 24 files and 2 apps, the difference would be 24 - 2 = 22. That means he has 22 more files than apps left on his phone.\n\nWait a minute, is there more to this problem? It mentions that he deleted some apps and files, but does that affect the final answer? The question is about how many more files than apps he has left, not about how many he deleted. So, maybe I don't need to worry about the deletion part for this particular question.\n\nLet me double-check. The problem says: \"After deleting some apps and files, he had 24 files and 2 apps left. How many more files than apps does he have left on the phone?\"\n\nYes, it's straightforward. He has 24 files and 2 apps left, so the difference is 22.\n\nBut maybe the deletion part is just additional information that isn't needed for the question being asked. Perhaps it's there to try to confuse me.\n\nTo make sure, let's consider if the deletion affects the final counts. The problem states that after deleting some apps and files, he has 2 apps and 24 files left. So, the deletion process is already accounted for, and we're only concerned with the final counts.\n\nTherefore, the number of apps left is 2, and the number of files left is 24. The difference is 24 - 2 = 22.\n\nSo, the answer should be 22.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"how many more files than apps does he have left on the phone?\" and 24 - 2 is indeed 22.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes these problems might involve considering the deletion amounts, but in this case, it's not necessary because the final counts are given directly.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nSuppose I try to find out how many apps and files he deleted.\n\nHe started with 11 apps and deleted some to end up with 2 apps. So, he deleted 11 - 2 = 9 apps.\n\nHe started with 3 files and ended up with 24 files. That seems odd because he started with 3 files and ended up with 24, which means he must have added files, not just deleted them.\n\nWait, the problem says he deleted some apps and files. It doesn't say he only deleted, but perhaps he added some files as well.\n\nBut according to the problem, after deleting some apps and files, he had 24 files and 2 apps left.\n\nIf he started with 3 files and ended up with 24, that's an increase of 21 files. So, perhaps he added 21 files and deleted some.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that he added files, only that he deleted some apps and files.\n\nMaybe it's assumed that any change in number is due to deletion only, but in this case, files increased, which suggests that he might have added files.\n\nBut again, the question is only asking for the difference between files and apps left on the phone, not about how many he deleted or added.\n\nSo, focusing on the final counts: 24 files and 2 apps.\n\nDifference: 24 - 2 = 22.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 22.\n\nI think that's straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is trying to test if I can calculate the difference correctly, and the deletion part is just background information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nStarting apps: 11\n\nDeleted some apps, ended with 2 apps.\n\nSo, deleted 11 - 2 = 9 apps.\n\nStarting files: 3\n\nDeleted some files, ended with 24 files.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. If he started with 3 files and ended with 24, that's an increase. So, he must have added files.\n\nPerhaps the problem meant that he added some files and deleted some apps and files, but the exact numbers are not specified.\n\nBut the question is still about the final difference between files and apps.\n\nSo, regardless of how he got there, he ends up with 24 files and 2 apps.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 24", "answer": 22, "equiv": false}, {"output": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. So, the problem says: \"Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 11. If each group has 2 eggs. How many eggs does Rebecca have?\"\n\nHmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance. It mentions splitting eggs into groups of 11, but then says each group has 2 eggs. That doesn't make sense to me because if she's splitting them into groups of 11, each group should have 11 eggs, right? Maybe I'm misreading it.\n\nLet me read it again: \"Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 11. If each group has 2 eggs.

Perhaps it's a typo and it's supposed to say something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a division problem where she's trying to divide her eggs into groups of 11, but each group ends up having only 2 eggs. That would imply that she doesn't have enough eggs to make full groups of 11.\n\nBut that doesn't sound right either.

Maybe she has groups of 2 eggs, and she has 11 such groups.\n\nBut the problem says \"split a collection of eggs into groups of 11. If each group has 2 eggs.\"\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to look at it differently.\n\nLet me consider that she wants to split her eggs into groups of 11, but for some reason, each group only ends up with 2 eggs. So, she has some number of groups, each with 2 eggs, and she was trying to make groups of 11.\n\nMaybe she intended to make groups of 11, but due to fewer eggs, each group has only 2 eggs. So, perhaps she has only a few groups.\n\nBut without knowing the number of groups, I can't determine the total number of eggs.\n\nWait a minute, maybe the problem is about multiplication or division.\n\nIf each group has 2 eggs, and there are 11 groups, then total eggs would be 2 multiplied by 11, which is 22.\n\nBut the problem doesn't say she has 11 groups; it says she splits into groups of 11, but then each group has 2 eggs, which is contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about division, where the total number of eggs is being divided into groups of 11, and each group has 2 eggs.\n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe it's about finding a common multiple or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a problem where she has a certain number of eggs, and when she tries to divide them into groups of 11, there's some remainder, but again, the problem says each group has 2 eggs.\n\nI'm really confused by the wording here.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the problem, and it's supposed to be \"Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 11. If she has 2 groups, how many eggs does she have?\" In that case, it would be straightforward: 11 eggs per group times 2 groups equals 22 eggs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 11. If each group had 2 eggs left over, how many eggs does she have?\" But that introduces a remainder concept, which isn't present in the current wording.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps it's a ratio problem, where for every 11 eggs, there are 2 in a group, but that also seems unclear.\n\nI think the problem might have a typo or poor wording. Given that, I'll make an assumption to proceed.\n\nAssuming the problem meant: \"Rebecca splits her eggs into groups of 11, and she has 2 such groups.\" Then, the total number of eggs would be 11 eggs/group times 2 groups, which equals 22 eggs.\n\nAlternatively, if it meant \"Rebecca splits her eggs into groups of 11, but each group only has 2 eggs,\" then that suggests she intended to have groups of ", "answer": 22, "equiv": false}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "44", "answer": 44, "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": 6, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "45", "answer": 45, "equiv": true}, {"output": "22", "answer": 22, "equiv": true}, {"output": "101", "answer": 101, "equiv": true}, {"output": "103", "answer": 103, "equiv": true}, {"output": "126", "answer": 126, "equiv": true}, {"output": "13", "answer": 13, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "9", "answer": 9, "equiv": true}, {"output": "45", "answer": 45, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "41", "answer": 41, "equiv": true}, {"output": "15", "answer": 15, "equiv": true}, {"output": "25", "answer": 25, "equiv": true}, {"output": "348", "answer": 348, "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": 8, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "68", "answer": 13, "equiv": false}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "32", "answer": 32, "equiv": true}, {"output": "51", "answer": 51, "equiv": true}, {"output": "268627", "answer": 268627, "equiv": true}, {"output": "14", "answer": 14, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this math problem here. Let's see what it's asking. It says that they harvest 66 sacks per day, and each sack contains 25 oranges. I need to find out how many oranges they will have after 87 days of harvest.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what's being asked. I think it's a straightforward multiplication problem, but I should break it down step by step to make sure I get it right.\n\nSo, they harvest 66 sacks per day, and each sack has 25 oranges. That means, every day, they harvest 66 times 25 oranges. Then, to find out the total after 87 days, I'll need to multiply the daily harvest by the number of days.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal oranges = (sacks per day) \u00d7 (oranges per sack) \u00d7 (number of days)\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nTotal oranges = 66 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 87\n\nNow, multiplying three numbers might be a bit tricky, so maybe I can make this easier by breaking it down.\n\nFirst, I can multiply the sacks per day by the number of days to find out the total number of sacks harvested.\n\nTotal sacks = 66 \u00d7 87\n\nThen, multiply the total sacks by the number of oranges per sack to get the total oranges.\n\nTotal oranges = Total sacks \u00d7 25\n\nAlternatively, I could multiply 66 by 25 first and then multiply that result by 87. Either way should give me the same answer.\n\nLet me try the first approach: calculate the total sacks first.\n\nSo, 66 \u00d7 87.\n\nI'm a bit rusty on multiplying two two-digit numbers in my head, so I'll break it down.\n\nI know that 66 \u00d7 80 is 5,280 because 66 \u00d7 8 = 528, and then multiplied by 10 is 5,280.\n\nThen, 66 \u00d7 7 is 462.\n\nNow, add those two results together: 5,280 + 462 = 5,742.\n\nSo, the total number of sacks harvested in 87 days is 5,742.\n\nNext, each sack contains 25 oranges, so total oranges are 5,742 \u00d7 25.\n\nAgain, multiplying by 25 can be tricky, but I know that 25 is the same as 100 divided by 4. So, I can multiply 5,742 by 100 and then divide by 4.\n\nFirst, 5,742 \u00d7 100 = 574,200.\n\nThen, divide that by 4: 574,200 \u00f7 4.\n\nWell, 4 goes into 574,200 how many times?\n\nLet's see, 4 \u00d7 143,550 = 574,200.\n\nSo, the total number of oranges is 143,550.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Maybe I should check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me verify the first part: 66 \u00d7 87.\n\n66 \u00d7 80 = 5,280\n\n66 \u00d7 7 = 462\n\n5,280 + 462 = 5,742. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 5,742 \u00d7 25.\n\nUsing the method of multiplying by 100 and dividing by 4:\n\n5,742 \u00d7 100 = 574,200\n\n574,200 \u00f7 4 = 143,550\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could have multiplied 66 \u00d7 25 first and then multiplied that by 87.\n\nLet me try that to double-check.\n\n66 \u00d7 25:\n\nWell, 66 \u00d7 20 = 1,320\n\n66 \u00d7 5 = 330\n\nAdd them together: 1,320 + 330 = 1,650\n\nSo, 66 \u00d7 25 = 1,650\n\nNow, multiply that by 87:\n\n1,650 \u00d7 87\n\nHmm, another multiplication to do.\n\nI can break it down again: 1,650 \u00d7 80 + 1,650 \u00d7 7.\n\n1,650 \u00d7 80: well, 1,650 \u00d7 8 = 13,200, and then multiplied", "answer": 143550, "equiv": false}, {"output": "106", "answer": 106, "equiv": true}, {"output": "574", "answer": 574, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "15", "answer": 15, "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": 13, "equiv": false}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

Maybe there's a mistake in the problem itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that after selling some books and then buying 42 new ones, he has 15 books in total, including the new ones and minus the sold ones.\n\nBut mathematically, it still leads to the same equation.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that when he sold books, he received money, and then used that money to buy new books. But the problem doesn't specify anything about money, just the number of books.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to say that after selling some books and buying new ones, his total is now 15 books, which seems odd because selling and buying should typically increase or decrease his collection, but ending up with fewer books is possible if he sold more than he bought.\n\nBut in terms of numbers:\n\nHe had 21 books.\n\nSold s books, so had 21 - s books left.\n\nBought 42 new books, so total books became (21 - s) + 42.\n\nThis equals 15.\n\nSo, (21 - s) + 42 = 15\n\nSimplify:\n\n21 + 42 - s = 15\n\n63 - s = 15\n\ns = 63 - 15\n\ns = 48\n\nAgain, s = 48.\n\nBut 48 is greater than his initial 21 books.

So, the number of blocks might be irrelevant for finding the number of houses per block, as long as we're consistent with the mail per block and mail per house.\n\nBut maybe I should consider the total mail delivered to all blocks to see if that makes sense.\n\nTotal mail delivered = number of blocks * mail per block = 55 * 32.\n\nBut since we're only asked about the number of houses per block, and we've got that it's 4 houses per block, maybe that's all we need.\n\nAlternatively, if we wanted to find the total number of houses across all blocks, we could do that, but the question is specifically about one block.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nPerhaps I can set up an equation.\n\nLet h be the number of houses per block.\n\nThen, mail per block = mail per house * number of houses per block.\n\nSo, 32 = 8 * h.\n\nSolving for h, h = 32 / 8 = 4.\n\nYeah, that matches what I got earlier.\n\nIs there a possibility that the mail per house is not uniformly 8 across all blocks? The problem says \"he gives 8 mails to each house in a block,\" so it seems consistent.\n\nAlso, it's important to note that the number of houses per block is the same in all blocks, but the problem doesn't specify that, so maybe it varies from block to block. However, since it's giving a general scenario, I think it's safe to assume that each block has the same number of houses.\n\nBut even if it varies, the problem is asking for the number of houses in a block, and given the information per block, it's consistent.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should consider that the total mail per block is 32, and if each house gets 8 mails, then regardless of how many houses there are, as long as the total is 32, but that doesn't make sense because if more houses, less mail per house, but in this case, it's specified that each house gets 8 mails.\n\nSo, to keep the total mail per block at 32, with each house getting 8 mails, the number of houses must be 4.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I'm missing.\n\nIs there any chance that some mail is not delivered to houses, or is there waste or anything like that? The problem doesn't mention any of that, so I think it's safe to assume all mail is delivered to houses.\n\nAlso, perhaps there are houses that don't get any mail, but the problem says \"he gives 8 mails to each house in a block,\" so it seems all houses get mail.\n\nWait, maybe there are houses that don't get mail, but the ones that do get 8 each. But the problem says \"each house in a block\" gets 8 mails, so probably all houses get mail.\n\nGiven that, it seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 32 mails per block include some that aren't delivered to houses, but the problem says \"he gives 8 mails to each house in a block,\" which suggests that all the mails are given to houses.\n\nSo, if each block gets 32 mails, and each house gets 8 mails, then the number of houses is 32 divided by 8, which is 4.\n\nLet me check the units to make sure.\n\nMail per block is 32 mails.\n\nMail per house is 8 mails.\n\nSo, number of houses per block is", "answer": 4, "equiv": false}, {"output": "27", "answer": 27, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Paul starts with a box of 65 crayons. Then, during the school year, he gives away 213 crayons to his friends and loses 16 crayons. The question is asking how many crayons have been lost or given away in total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It's clear that we need to find the total number of crayons that Paul has gotten rid of, either by giving them away or losing them. So, that means I should add the number of crayons he gave away to the number he lost.\n\nHe gave away 213 crayons and lost 16 crayons. So, the total number of crayons lost or given away is 213 plus 16.\n\nLet me do that addition: 213 + 16.\n\n16 plus 213.\n\nWell, 213 plus 10 is 223, and then plus 6 is 229.\n\nSo, 213 + 16 = 229.\n\nWait a minute, but Paul started with only 65 crayons. How can he give away 213 crayons if he only had 65 to begin with?\n\nThat doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem.\n\nOr perhaps Paul received more crayons after the initial 65, but the problem doesn't mention that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick me, and I need to consider that Paul couldn't have given away more crayons than he had.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nIf Paul had 65 crayons and gave away 213, that wouldn't be possible unless he got more crayons somewhere else.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention that. So maybe I should consider that he gave away 213 crayons in total, but since he only had 65, he must have gotten more crayons before giving away the rest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake, and the numbers don't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nThe question is: \"How many crayons had been lost or given away?\"\n\nIt's asking for the total number of crayons that were either lost or given away by Paul.\n\nSo, regardless of how many crayons he started with, the total given away is 213, and the total lost is 16.\n\nTherefore, the total crayons lost or given away is indeed 213 + 16 = 229.\n\nBut again, that seems inconsistent with the initial 65 crayons. Maybe the problem is trying to teach me about negative numbers or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is just to add those two numbers, and the initial 65 crayons is irrelevant for this particular question.\n\nThe problem says: \"How many crayons had been lost or given away?\"\n\nSo, it's not asking how many crayons Paul has left; it's asking for the total number of crayons that were lost or given away.\n\nTherefore, I should just add the crayons lost and given away: 213 + 16 = 229.\n\nSo, the answer should be 229 crayons.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because Paul couldn't have given away more crayons than he had unless he got more crayons somehow.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't mention that, maybe I should stick to the information given and just add the two numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me into thinking about the impossibility of giving away more crayons than one has.\n\nBut the question isn't asking about how many crayons Paul has left; it's asking about the total crayons lost or given away.\n\nSo, based on the information provided, the total is 213 + 16 = 229.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 229.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense in reality because Paul couldn't have given away more crayons than he had.\n\nMaybe the problem is incorrectly stated, or perhaps it's a trick question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 213 crayons given away include the original 65 plus additional crayons he got later.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nI think I need to clarify this.\n\nIf Paul had 65 crayons and gave away 213, that's not possible unless he acquired more crayons in between.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't mention that, perhaps the initial 65 crayons are irrelevant to the question being asked.\n\nThe question is specifically about the total crayons lost or given away, which is 213 + 16 = 229.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is indeed 229.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to find out how many crayons he no longer has, which", "answer": 229, "equiv": false}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "20", "answer": 20, "equiv": true}, {"output": "65", "answer": 65, "equiv": true}, {"output": "11", "answer": 11, "equiv": true}, {"output": "17", "answer": 17, "equiv": true}, {"output": "17", "answer": 17, "equiv": true}, {"output": "190", "answer": 190, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. So, the recipe calls for certain amounts of sugar, flour, and salt, and Mary has already added some flour. We need to find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt she needs to add now.\n\nFirst, let's list out what the recipe requires:\n\n- Sugar: 11 cups\n\n- Flour: 6 cups\n\n- Salt: 9 cups\n\nNow, Mary has already added 12 cups of flour, but the recipe only calls for 6 cups. That means she has added more flour than needed. But the question is about sugar and salt, so maybe the extra flour affects something else, but for now, let's focus on sugar and salt.\n\nWe need to find out how much more sugar than salt Mary needs to add. So, we need to calculate the amount of sugar she still needs to add and the amount of salt she still needs to add, and then find the difference between those two amounts.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much sugar she needs to add. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar, and it doesn't mention that she has already added any sugar, so she needs to add all 11 cups of sugar.\n\nNext, for salt, the recipe calls for 9 cups, and again, it doesn't mention that she has added any salt already, so she needs to add all 9 cups of salt.\n\nNow, the difference between the cups of sugar and cups of salt she needs to add is:\n\n11 cups (sugar) - 9 cups (salt) = 2 cups\n\nSo, Mary needs to add 2 more cups of sugar than cups of salt.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says she already put in 12 cups of flour, which is more than the recipe calls for. Maybe this affects something else. Perhaps the ratios need to be maintained, and since she added extra flour, she needs to adjust the other ingredients accordingly.\n\nLet's consider that possibility. The original recipe has a ratio of sugar to flour to salt of 11:6:9.\n\nBut she has added 12 cups of flour, which is 12/6 = 2 times the amount of flour in the recipe. So, maybe she needs to multiply the other ingredients by 2 as well.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Sugar needed: 11 cups * 2 = 22 cups\n\n- Salt needed: 9 cups * 2 = 18 cups\n\nThen, the difference between sugar and salt would be:\n\n22 cups - 18 cups = 4 cups\n\nSo, in this scenario, Mary needs to add 4 more cups of sugar than salt.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the ingredients need to be scaled proportionally. It just says the recipe calls for certain amounts, and she has already added 12 cups of flour.\n\nPerhaps the recipe must be followed exactly, and adding extra flour is a mistake. In that case, she still needs to add the prescribed amounts of sugar and salt, which are 11 cups and 9 cups, respectively, and the difference is 2 cups.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the extra flour requires adjusting the other ingredients proportionally.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Let's see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nPerhaps we should consider the ratios.\n\nOriginal recipe:\n\nSugar: 11 cups\n\nFlour: 6 cups\n\nSalt: 9 cups\n\nSo, the ratio of sugar to flour is 11:6, and sugar to salt is 11:9.\n\nMary has added 12 cups of flour, which is double the amount of flour in the recipe (since 12 / 6 = 2).\n\nIf she doubles the flour, she might need to double the other ingredients to keep the proportions the same.\n\nSo, doubling the sugar: 11 * 2 = 22 cups\n\nDoubling the salt: 9 * 2 = 18 cups\n\nThen, the difference between sugar and salt would be 22 - 18 = 4 cups.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ratios are different.\n\nWait, maybe I should set up proportions.\n\nIf 6 cups of flour require 11 cups of sugar, then 12 cups of flour would require X cups of sugar.\n\nSo, set up a proportion:\n\n6/11 = 12/X\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. If 6 cups of flour require 11 cups of sugar, then 12 cups of flour would require X cups of sugar, where X = (11/6) * 12 = 22 cups.\n\nSimilarly, for salt:\n\n6 cups of flour require 9 cups of salt, so 12 cups of flour would require Y cups of salt, where Y = (9/6) * 12 = 18 cups.\n\nSo again", "answer": 2, "equiv": false}, {"output": "63", "answer": 63, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "30057", "answer": 30057, "equiv": true}, {"output": "192", "answer": 192, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Okay, so I have this problem here about Nell and her cards.

She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 376 Ace cards and 111 baseball cards left.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. It's unusual to give cards away and end up with more than you started with. Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be 376 Ace cards in total, including what she gave to Jeff, but that doesn't align with the wording.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she traded cards with Jeff, exchanging baseball cards for Ace cards. That could explain why she has more Ace cards than she started with after giving some away.\n\nBut according to the problem, she \"gave some of her cards to Jeff\" and now has 376 Ace cards and 111 baseball cards left.\n\nAssuming that she only gave away baseball cards, and perhaps received Ace cards in return, but the problem says she \"gave some of her cards to Jeff,\" not necessarily trading.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should focus on what the problem is asking for and not worry about the story.\n\nThe question is, \"How many more Ace cards than baseball cards does Nell have?\"\n\nSo, currently, she has 376 Ace cards and 111 baseball cards.\n\nTo find out how many more Ace cards she has than baseball cards, I can subtract the number of baseball cards from the number of Ace cards.\n\nSo, 376 (Ace cards) - 111 (baseball cards) = ?\n\nLet me do that calculation.\n\n376 - 111 = 265.\n\nSo, Nell has 265 more Ace cards than baseball cards.\n\nWait, but the problem seems to have a mistake because she started with 38 Ace cards and now has 376, which is more than she started with, but it says she gave some cards to Jeff. Unless she received Ace cards from Jeff in exchange for baseball cards.\n\nBut regardless of that, the question is just asking for the difference between the number of Ace cards and baseball cards she has now, which is 376 - 111 = 265.\n\nSo, the answer should be 265.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nMaybe the problem is trying to say that she had 239 baseball cards and 38 Ace cards initially, gave some to Jeff, and now has 376 Ace cards and 111 baseball cards, and we need to find out how many more Ace cards than baseball cards she has now.\n\nYes, that's the same as what I did.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the difference between the number of Ace cards and baseball cards she has now, which is indeed 376 - 111 = 265.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem, and it's supposed to be that she had 376 Ace cards initially and ended with 38, but that doesn't make sense with the wording.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a misprint, and it's supposed to be 376 baseball cards and 111 Ace cards left, but that doesn't align with the question asked.\n\nBut based on the information given, she now has 376 Ace cards and 111 baseball cards, and the question is how many more Ace cards than baseball cards she has.\n\nSo, 376 - 111", "answer": 265, "equiv": false}, {"output": "298", "answer": 298, "equiv": true}, {"output": "728", "answer": 728, "equiv": true}, {"output": "21", "answer": 21, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "45", "answer": 45, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3168", "answer": 3168, "equiv": true}, {"output": "345", "answer": 345, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "28", "answer": 28, "equiv": true}, {"output": "77", "answer": 77, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this math problem here: \"If the cave is 919 feet deep and they need to travel 1307 feet.

The cave is 919 feet deep, and they need to travel 1307 feet. Does that mean they're going into the cave and then beyond it, or what?\n\nMaybe I should visualize this. Imagine a cave that goes down 919 feet, and they need to travel a total of 1307 feet. So, if they start at the entrance, go down into the cave 919 feet, and then keep going another certain distance, the total travel would be 1307 feet. So, the end of the cave must be beyond the initial 919 feet.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the cave is 919 feet deep,\" which probably means that's the total depth of the cave. So, if they need to travel 1307 feet, maybe they have to go through the cave and then continue past it. But that doesn't make much sense. Maybe it's not about depth but about length.\n\nPerhaps the cave is 919 feet long, and they need to travel 1307 feet to reach the end. That seems contradictory because if the cave is 919 feet long, the end should be at 919 feet, not 1307 feet. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nLet me read it again: \"If the cave is 919 feet deep and they need to travel 1307 feet. How far is the end of the cave?\" Maybe it's about traveling through the cave and then some. Perhaps the end of the cave is beyond the 919 feet, but that doesn't make sense because the cave is stated to be 919 feet deep.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the end of the cave\" refers to another point beyond the cave, and they need to travel 1307 feet in total, including the cave's depth. In that case, perhaps they need to find out how far beyond the cave's depth they need to travel.\n\nWait, maybe it's a straight-line distance problem. Suppose the cave is 919 feet deep, and they need to travel 1307 feet to reach the end of the cave in a straight line. Maybe it's a diagonal path, and the cave is not vertical but at an angle.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the horizontal distance. So, if the cave is 919 feet deep, and the straight-line distance is 1307 feet, then the horizontal distance would be the square root of (1307^2 - 919^2).\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\nFirst, calculate 1307 squared:\n\n1307 * 1307 = Let's see, 1300 * 1300 = 1,690,000, and 7 * 1300 = 9,100, so total 1,690,000 + 9,100 + 9,100 + 49 = 1,708,249.\n\nNow, 919 squared:\n\n900 * 900 = 810,000, and 19 * 900 = 17,100, so 810,000 + 17,100 + 17,100 + 361 = 844,361.\n\nNow, subtract the two:\n\n1,708,249 - 844,361 = 863,888.\n\nNow, take the square root of 863,888.\n\nWell, 930 squared is 864,900. Let's see, 920 squared is 846,400, and 930 squared is 864,900, which is higher than 863,888. So, maybe 929 squared:\n\n929 * 929 = 920 * 930 + 9^2 = 851,400 + 81 = 851,481.

Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. \"Rachel had to complete 2 pages of math homework, 3 pages of reading homework, and 10 more pages of biology homework. How many pages did she have to complete in all?\"\n\nOkay, so Rachel has homework in three different subjects: math, reading, and biology. She has 2 pages of math, 3 pages of reading, and 10 more pages of biology. The question is asking for the total number of pages she has to complete.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what \"10 more pages of biology homework\" means. Does it mean that she has 10 pages specifically for biology, or is it 10 pages more than something else? Looking back at the problem, it says \"2 pages of math homework, 3 pages of reading homework, and 10 more pages of biology homework.\" I think it means that in addition to the math and reading homework, she has 10 more pages for biology.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider whether \"10 more pages\" is in addition to the math and reading, or if it's separate. Let me see. If it says \"10 more pages of biology homework,\" it might be that biology homework is 10 pages plus whatever she has in other subjects. But that doesn't make much sense. I think it's better to interpret it as she has 2 pages of math, 3 pages of reading, and 10 pages of biology, and I need to add all these up.\n\nSo, total pages would be math pages plus reading pages plus biology pages. That is, 2 + 3 + 10.\n\nLet me add those up. 2 plus 3 is 5, and then 5 plus 10 is 15.\n\nSo, Rachel has to complete 15 pages in all.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should check if \"10 more pages of biology homework\" means something else. Like, perhaps it's 10 pages additional to the math and reading combined. Let's see.\n\nIf that's the case, then biology homework would be 10 pages plus the sum of math and reading homework pages. So, biology homework would be 10 + (2 + 3) = 10 + 5 = 15 pages.\n\nThen, total pages would be math + reading + biology, which is 2 + 3 + 15 = 20 pages.\n\nBut that seems different from my first approach. I need to decide which interpretation is correct.\n\nLooking back at the problem, it says \"2 pages of math homework, 3 pages of reading homework, and 10 more pages of biology homework.\" The phrase \"10 more pages\" might be indicating that biology homework is 10 pages more than something else, perhaps than the reading homework.\n\nIf that's the case, then biology homework would be 3 pages (reading) + 10 pages = 13 pages.\n\nThen, total pages would be 2 (math) + 3 (reading) + 13 (biology) = 18 pages.\n\nHmm, now I have three different possible totals: 15, 20, and 18 pages. I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nMaybe I should consider the punctuation and wording again. The problem says, \"2 pages of math homework, 3 pages of reading homework, and 10 more pages of biology homework.\" The commas separate the different homework assignments, suggesting that they are distinct amounts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"10 more pages of biology homework\" means that biology homework is 10 pages additional to the combined total of math and reading.\n\nIn that case, biology homework would be 10 pages plus the sum of math and reading homework, which is 10 + (2 + 3) = 15 pages.\n\nThen, the total pages would be 2 + 3 + 15 = 20 pages.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right interpretation. Maybe I should consider that \"10 more pages\" refers to biology being 10 pages more than either math or reading.\n\nIf biology is 10 pages more than math, then biology would be 2 + 10 = 12 pages.\n\nTotal pages would be 2 + 3 + 12 = 17 pages.\n\nIf biology is 10 pages more than reading, then biology would be 3 + 10 = 13 pages.\n\nTotal pages would be 2 + 3 + 13 = 18 pages.\n\nThis is getting confusing. I have multiple interpretations leading to different answers.

If you read 7 of the books and watched 21 of the movies. How many more movies than books have you read?\"\n\nHmm, it seems there's an inconsistency because there are only 17 movies, but I watched 21. Maybe it's a trick question, or maybe it's a typo. Perhaps it's meant to be 17 movies and I watched 12, or something like that. But as it is, it's saying I watched 21 movies when there are only 17.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that \"17 different movies\" means there are 17 unique movies, but perhaps some can be watched multiple times. But the problem says \"watched 21 of the movies.\" If it's allowing for watching the same movie multiple times, then it's possible to watch more movies than there are unique titles.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"different movies,\" which typically means each movie is unique. So, watching a movie more than once wouldn't count as a different movie. Therefore, watching 21 different movies when there are only 17 doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the series has more movies than stated, or maybe it's considering movies from different parts of the series.\n\nGiven that, I'll assume that the problem intended to say that there are more movies than 17, or perhaps there's a miscount. For the sake of solving the problem, I might need to proceed with the given numbers, even if they seem inconsistent.\n\nSo, according to the problem, I've read 7 books and watched 21 movies. It's asking how many more movies than books I have read.\n\nFirst, I need to find the difference between the number of movies watched and the number of books read.\n\nThat would be:\n\nNumber of movies watched - Number of books read = 21 - 7 = 14\n\nSo, I've read 14 more movies than books.\n\nBut, considering the inconsistency earlier, I'm a bit unsure about this answer. Maybe there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem meant that I watched 17 movies and read 7 books, and 17 - 7 = 10. But that's not what the problem says.\n\nOr maybe it's a trick question to test attention to detail, noticing that there are only 17 movies but I watched 21. In that case, perhaps the answer is that it's not possible, or maybe to consider only the available movies.\n\nIf I assume that I watched all 17 movies and somehow watched 4 more that don't exist, then perhaps the difference is still 14, but that seems unrealistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the extra movies watched are repetitions of the existing movies. In that case, the number of movies watched beyond the unique titles would be 21 - 17 = 4, meaning I watched 17 unique movies plus 4 repeats.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify anything about repeats, so perhaps that's not the right path.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with the initial calculation: 21 movies watched minus 7 books read equals 14 more movies watched than books read.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 14.\n\nBut to be thorough, I should consider if the problem is trying to test something else, like the number of books and movies remaining to be read or watched.\n\nThe problem says: \"How many more movies than books have you read?\"\n\nIt's specifically asking about the number of movies watched compared to books read, not about remaining books or movies.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 21 - 7 = 14.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 14.\n\nWait, but considering the inconsistency, maybe the problem intended to say that there are 17 movies and I watched all of them, and read 7 books, so the difference is", "answer": 14, "equiv": false}, {"output": "7", "answer": 7, "equiv": true}, {"output": "9", "answer": 9, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. So, the problem says: \"A waiter had 3 customers. After some left, he still had 4 customers. How many more customers stayed behind than those that left?\"\n\nHmm, this seems a bit tricky at first glance. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the waiter started with 3 customers. Then, some customers left, but after that, he still had 4 customers. Wait, that doesn't make sense immediately because if he started with 3 and some left, you'd expect him to have fewer than 3, not more.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in the way I'm understanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A waiter had 3 customers. After some left, he still had 4 customers. How many more customers stayed behind than those that left?\"\n\nAlright, perhaps there's some information missing or misinterpreted. Maybe the waiter had more customers initially, and even after some left, he still had 4. But the problem says he started with 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding of the terms. Let's consider that the waiter initially had 3 customers, then some new customers arrived, and after some left, he had 4 remaining.\n\nBut the problem says \"after some left, he still had 4 customers,\" which suggests that the number after some left is 4. But starting from 3, if some leave, you should have fewer than 3, not more.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Let's assume that maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be that he had 3 customers, then some new ones arrived, and after some left, he had 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the waiter had 3 customers at one point, then some customers left, but he gained new ones, ending up with 4.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify any new customers arriving; it only mentions some leaving.\n\nLet me try to approach this differently. Let's use variables to represent the unknowns.\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\n- Initial number of customers: 3\n\n- Number of customers who left: L\n\n- Number of customers remaining: 4\n\nBut according to this, 3 - L = 4, which would mean L = -1. That doesn't make sense because the number of customers who left can't be negative.\n\nThis suggests there's probably an error in the problem as stated. Maybe it's supposed to be that he had 3 customers, then some new ones arrived, and after some left, he had 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the waiter had 3 customers in one group and another group of customers, and after some left, he had 4 remaining.\n\nBut without clear information, it's hard to proceed.\n\nLet\u2019s consider another angle. Maybe \"had 3 customers\" means he served 3 tables or something, and then some customers left, but he still had 4 customers at another table.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. I think the problem might have been miswritten or missing some information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"had 3 customers\" means he initially had 3 customers, then more arrived, and after some left, he still had 4.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that initially, he had 3 customers, then X more arrived, and then Y left, resulting in 4 customers.\n\nSo, the equation would be: 3 + X - Y = 4.\n\nBut with this equation, we have two variables, and we can't solve for specific values without additional information.\n\nWait, the problem is asking for \"how many more customers stayed behind than those that left.\" That would be (X - Y), where X is the number who stayed and Y is the number who left.\n\nBut in our equation, X would be the number who arrived, and Y who left, and the number who stayed would be 3 + X - Y = 4.\n\nSo, the number who stayed is 4, and the number who left is Y.\n\nThe problem is asking for how many more customers stayed behind than those that left, which would be 4 - Y.\n\nBut we need to find a specific number, so we need to find Y.\n\nGiven that 3 + X - Y = 4, then X - Y = 1.\n\nSo, the number of customers who stayed behind is 1 more than those who left.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but let's double-check this reasoning.\n\nWe have:\n\nInitial customers: 3\n\nCustomers who arrived: X\n\nCustomers who left: Y\n\nCustomers remaining: 4\n\nSo, 3 + X - Y = 4\n\nThen, X - Y = 1\n\nThe problem is asking for how many more customers stayed behind than those that left.\n\nThe number who stayed behind is 4.\n\nThe number who left is Y.\n\nSo, 4 - Y.\n\nBut from X - Y = 1, and X is the number who arrived", "answer": 5, "equiv": false}, {"output": "22", "answer": 22, "equiv": true}, {"output": "11", "answer": 11, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "112", "answer": 112, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "32", "answer": 32, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this math problem here, and I need to solve it step by step.

The question is, how many crackers did each person eat?\n\nFirst, I need to understand who is eating what. It says Matthew gave crackers and cakes to his 4 friends, and he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend. So, it's about dividing the crackers and cakes equally among his 4 friends.\n\nWait, but the question is about how many crackers each person ate. Does \"each person\" refer to Matthew and his friends, or just his friends? The problem says \"his 4 friends,\" so I think it's about how many crackers each friend received.\n\nBut the wording is a bit confusing because it says \"each person ate,\" but it doesn't specify if Matthew also ate some or if he only gave them to his friends. Maybe I need to assume that Matthew gave all the crackers and cakes to his friends and didn't eat any himself.\n\nLet me re-read the problem to make sure.\n\n\"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends. If he had 32 crackers and 98 cakes initially. How many crackers did each person eat?\"\n\nHmm, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding here. The problem says he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend. So, each friend received the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes.\n\nBut the question is about how many crackers each person ate. I think \"each person\" refers to each friend, and \"ate\" might mean received, since there's no information about anyone eating beyond receiving.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some crackers were eaten during the giving, but that seems unlikely. I think \"ate\" is probably a mistake and should be \"received.\" Or maybe it's just poorly worded.\n\nAnyway, I'll proceed with the assumption that \"each person ate\" means \"each friend received.\"\n\nSo, Matthew has 32 crackers and 98 cakes, and he gives equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each of his 4 friends.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many crackers each friend received.\n\nSince he has 32 crackers and 4 friends, and he gives an equal number to each, I can divide the total number of crackers by the number of friends.\n\nSo, 32 crackers \u00f7 4 friends = 8 crackers per friend.\n\nSimilarly, for the cakes: 98 cakes \u00f7 4 friends = 24.5 cakes per friend.\n\nBut the problem says he gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to each friend. Wait, but 8 crackers and 24.5 cakes are not equal numbers. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nLet me read the problem again carefully.\n\n\"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends.\"\n\nDoes this mean that each friend received the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes, or that the total number of crackers and cakes given to each friend was equal?\n\nI think it's the former: each friend received the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes.\n\nBut in that case, 8 crackers and 24.5 cakes per friend doesn't make sense because you can't give half a cake if we're dealing with whole cakes.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that he gave away whole crackers and whole cakes.\n\nSo, perhaps 98 cakes divided by 4 friends is not 24.5 cakes per friend, but maybe he couldn't give an equal whole number of cakes to each friend.\n\nBut the problem says he did give equal numbers, so maybe I need to find a number that divides both 32 and 98 equally among the 4 friends.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that each friend received an equal number of crackers and an equal number of cakes, but those numbers don't have to be the same between crackers and cakes.\n\nWait, the problem says \"equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends.\"\n\nSo, perhaps each friend received the same number of crackers and the same number of cakes.\n\nBut 32 crackers divided by 4 is 8 crackers per friend, and 98 cakes divided by 4 is 24.5 cakes per friend, which doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"equal numbers\" means that the number of crackers each friend received is equal to the number of cakes each friend received.\n\nSo, each friend received the same number of crackers as cakes.\n\nIn that case, let's denote the number of crackers each friend received as x, and the number of cakes each friend received as x as well.\n\nSo, total crackers given away would be 4x, and total cakes given away would be 4x.\n\nBut Matthew had 32 crackers and 98 cakes initially.\n\nSo, 4x \u2264 ", "answer": 8, "equiv": false}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "20", "answer": 20, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

The problem says that she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. We need to find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how much flour and sugar she has already put in. We know the recipe calls for 13 cups of sugar, so presumably, she has already put in some sugar. But the problem doesn't specify how much sugar she has added, only that she needs to add more flour. Hmm, maybe she has added all the sugar already? Let's assume she has added all 13 cups of sugar, as the problem doesn't say otherwise.\n\nNow, she still needs to add some flour, and the amount of flour she still needs to add is 8 more cups than the sugar she has already put in. Since she has put in 13 cups of sugar, she needs to add 13 + 8 = 21 cups of flour.\n\nWait a minute, but the recipe only calls for 6 cups of flour.

If she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar. How many more cups of flour does she need to add?\"\n\nOkay, so the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar. She has already put in some flour, and she still needs to add more flour such that the amount of flour she still needs to add is 8 more cups than the sugar she has already put in.\n\nLet's define some variables to make this clearer. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( f \\) be the amount of flour she has already put in.\n\n- The total flour needed is 6 cups, so the flour she still needs to add is \\( 6 - f \\) cups.\n\n- Let \\( s \\) be the amount of sugar she has already put in. The recipe calls for 13 cups of sugar, so she still needs to add \\( 13 - s \\) cups of sugar.\n\nAccording to the problem, the amount of flour she still needs to add is 8 more cups than the sugar she has already put in. So, that would be:\n\n\\[ 6 - f = s + 8 \\]\n\nNow, we have an equation involving \\( f \\) and \\( s \\). But we have two variables here, and we need another equation to solve for both variables.\n\nWait, maybe the problem assumes that she has already put in all the sugar, so \\( s = 13 \\). Let's check that possibility.\n\nIf \\( s = 13 \\), then plugging into the equation:\n\n\\[ 6 - f = 13 + 8 \\]\n\n\\[ 6 - f = 21 \\]\n\n\\[ -f = 15 \\]\n\n\\[ f = -15 \\]\n\nNegative flour doesn't make sense. So, that can't be right. Maybe she hasn't added all the sugar yet.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that the amount of flour she still needs to add is 8 more cups than the amount of sugar she still needs to add.\n\nLet me re-read the problem: \"she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar.\"\n\nSo, maybe the amount of flour she still needs to add is 8 more cups than the amount of sugar she still needs to add.\n\nIn that case, the equation would be:\n\n\\[ 6 - f = (13 - s) + 8 \\]\n\nNow, let's simplify that:\n\n\\[ 6 - f = 21 - s \\]\n\nRearranging:\n\n\\[ -f + s = 15 \\]\n\n\\[ s - f = 15 \\]\n\nBut again, we have two variables and only one equation.

We need to find out how many kids she played with on Monday.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. It seems like there are some kids she played with on Monday and some on Tuesday, and altogether, there were 16 different kids. But, I need to consider if there's any overlap between the kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nWait a minute, the problem doesn't specify whether the kids on Monday and Tuesday are all different or if some kids played on both days. If there's an overlap, that would affect the total number of unique kids she played with.\n\nLet me think about this. If there's no overlap, meaning all the kids are different on each day, then the total number of kids she played with would be the sum of the kids from Monday and Tuesday. But according to the problem, she played with 14 kids on Tuesday and a total of 16 kids overall. If there's no overlap, then the number of kids on Monday would be 16 minus 14, which is 2. But I need to confirm if this is the case.\n\nHowever, if there is an overlap, meaning some kids played on both days, then the total number of unique kids would be less than the sum of the kids from each day. The formula for the total number of unique kids would be:\n\nTotal kids = Kids on Monday + Kids on Tuesday - Kids who played on both days.\n\nSo, if we let M be the number of kids she played with on Monday, and B be the number of kids who played on both days, then:\n\nTotal kids = M + 14 - B = 16.\n\nWe need to find M.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't provide information about how many kids played on both days.

She played tag with 14 kids on Tuesday.

If that's the case, then the number of kids she played with on Monday would simply be the total minus the number on Tuesday.\n\nSo, Kids on Monday = Total kids - Kids on Tuesday = 16 - 14 = 2.\n\nBut I should confirm if this is the correct approach. Let's consider if there could be overlapping kids.\n\nIf some kids played on both days, then the number of unique kids would be less than the sum of the individual days. But since the total is given as 16, and she played with 14 on Tuesday, if there is overlap, then the number of kids on Monday would need to be higher to account for the overlap.\n\nWait, but the total is 16, and she played with 14 on Tuesday. If some kids are in both days, then the number on Monday would be greater than 2.\n\nFor example, if 2 kids played on both days, then:\n\nTotal unique kids = M + 14 - 2 = 16.\n\nSo, M would be 4.\n\nBut if no kids played on both days, then M = 2.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the overlap, so it seems like there might be multiple answers depending on the overlap.\n\nHowever, perhaps the problem intends for us to assume that there is no overlap, meaning all kids are unique to each day. That would be the simplest case, and likely what is expected at this level.\n\nTherefore, Kids on Monday = Total kids - Kids on Tuesday = 16 - 14 = 2.\n\nSo, the answer should be 2.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nAnother way is to think that all the kids she played with on Tuesday are included in the total of 16, and we need to find out how many additional kids she played with on Monday.\n\nSo, if she played with 14 kids on Tuesday, and the total is 16, then she must have played with 16 - 14 = 2 kids on Monday who are not included on Tuesday.\n\nBut this assumes that the 14 kids on Tuesday are part of the total 16, which seems logical.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether there's overlap or not, the number of unique kids she played with on Monday would be 2, assuming that the total of 16 includes all unique kids from both days.\n\nI think that's the most reasonable approach.\n\n", "answer": 2, "equiv": false}, {"output": "32", "answer": 32, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": 7, "equiv": true}, {"output": "242", "answer": 242, "equiv": true}, {"output": "90", "answer": 90, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "105", "answer": 105, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

We need to find out how many planks John needs for the house wall.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. We have a total of 11 nails, and each plank requires 3 nails. But there are also 8 additional nails that were used for something else. So, I guess, the total nails used for the planks plus the additional nails equals 11.\n\nLet me try to translate this into an equation. Let\u2019s denote the number of planks as P.

The problem might be a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8 additional nails are part of the total 11 nails, meaning that the nails used for planks are 11 - 8 = 3 nails.\n\nThen, since each plank needs 3 nails, 3 nails would be enough for 1 plank.\n\nYes, that matches the previous calculation where P = 1.\n\nSo, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\n\nBut, the problem says \"planks\" in general, and I've concluded that only 1 plank is needed. Maybe I should consider if there's more to it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the additional 8 nails are used per plank. But that doesn't make much sense because then the total nails would be 3P + 8P = 11, which would be 11P = 11, so P = 1 again.\n\nWait, that might not be correct because the additional nails might not be per plank.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"11 nails in all to secure large planks of wood. If each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used...\"\n\nIt seems like the additional 8 nails are used separately from the nails used for the planks.\n\nSo, total nails = nails for planks + additional nails\n\nWhich is 11 = 3P + 8\n\nSolving for P, we get P = 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the additional 8 nails are included in the total 11 nails, and they are used for something else besides the planks.\n\nIn that case, the nails used for planks would be 11 - 8 = 3 nails, and since each plank needs 3 nails, P = 1.\n\nEither way, it seems that P = 1 is the answer.\n\nBut, to be thorough, let's consider if there could be more planks.\n\nSuppose P = 2, then nails for planks would be 6, and additional nails are 8, total 14, which is more than 11. That doesn't make sense.\n\nIf P = 0, then nails for planks are 0, and additional nails are 8, total 8, which is less than 11.\n\nSo, only P = 1 fits the equation 3P + 8 = 11.\n\nTherefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem says \"planks\" in plural form.

It wants to know the difference between the number of kids who stayed home and those who went to camp. So, essentially, I need to subtract the number of kids who went to camp from the number of kids who stayed home.\n\nSo, the calculation should be: kids stayed home - kids went to camp.\n\nThat is: 777,622 - 29,586.\n\nNow, I need to perform this subtraction.

Ends up with 15 roses in the vase.\n\nLet me try to model this mathematically.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Original roses: 21\n\n- Thrown away: 34\n\n- Added from garden: x\n\n- Final roses: 15\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n\nOriginal - Thrown away + Added = Final\n\n21 - 34 + x = 15\n\nNow, let's solve for x.\n\n21 - 34 = -13\n\nSo, -13 + x = 15\n\nTherefore, x = 15 + 13 = 28\n\nSo, she added 28 roses from her garden.\n\nNow, she threw away 34 roses and added 28 roses.\n\nThe question is, how many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?\n\nThat would be 34 - 28 = 6\n\nSo, she threw away 6 more roses than she cut from her garden.\n\nWait, but let's double-check this.\n\nOriginal: 21\n\nThrown away: 34 (but only 21 were in the vase, so maybe she threw away all 21 from the vase and 13 more from elsewhere)\n\nThen, added 28 new roses.\n\nNow, vase has 28 - 13 = 15 roses, which matches the final count.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she threw away 34 roses in total, some from the vase and some from elsewhere, and then added x roses to make it 15.\n\nBut the problem says she threw away 34 roses \"from the vase\" and then cut some more from her garden.\n\nWait, but there were only 21 roses in the vase to begin with. So, perhaps she threw away all 21 roses from the vase and 13 more from elsewhere.\n\nThen, she cut some roses from her garden and put them in the vase, ending up with 15 roses in the vase.\n\nSo, the number of roses added from the garden would be 15 - (original 21 - thrown away 21) + thrown away from elsewhere.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the net change in the number of roses in the vase.\n\nOriginal: 21\n\nFinal: 15\n\nSo, net change: 15 - 21 = -6\n\nBut she threw away 34 roses and added x roses.\n\nSo, -34 + x = -6\n\nTherefore, x = -6 + 34 = 28\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nSo, she added 28 roses from her garden.\n\nNow, she threw away 34 roses and added 28 roses.\n\nTherefore, she threw away 34 - 28 = 6 more roses than she added.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"how many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden?\"\n\nYes, that would be 34 - 28 = 6.\n\nAlternatively, since she threw away 34 and added 28, the difference is 6.\n\nSo, the answer should be 6.\n\nBut let me consider if there's another way to look at this.\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in assuming she threw away 34 roses when there were only 21 in the vase.\n\nPerhaps the problem means she threw away 34 roses in total, some from the vase and some from elsewhere.\n\nBut the problem says she threw away 34 roses \"from the vase\" and then cut some more from her garden.\n\nWait, but logically, she can't throw away more roses than were in the vase.\n\nMaybe the problem has a mistake.\n\nAlternatively", "answer": 6, "equiv": false}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2080", "answer": 2080, "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": 10, "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": 7, "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": 9, "equiv": false}, {"output": "11346", "answer": 11346, "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": 7, "equiv": true}, {"output": "13", "answer": 13, "equiv": true}, {"output": "96", "answer": 96, "equiv": true}, {"output": "11", "answer": 11, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So Jesse's room is 7 feet long, and she needs a carpet that's 14 square feet. I need to find out the width of her room. Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I know that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, for Jesse's room, the area should be length times width. And she needs a carpet that's 14 square feet, which I guess means the carpet should cover the entire floor of her room. So, the area of the room is 14 square feet.\n\nGiven that, I can set up the equation: length \u00d7 width = area.\n\nI know the length is 7 feet, and the area is 14 square feet. So, plugging in the values:\n\n7 feet \u00d7 width = 14 square feet.\n\nNow, I need to solve for the width. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 7 feet.\n\nSo, width = 14 square feet \u00f7 7 feet.\n\nWhen I do that, the feet in the denominator and one foot in the numerator cancel out, leaving me with just feet.\n\nSo, width = 14 \u00f7 7 = 2 feet.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too straightforward. Is there anything I'm missing here?\n\nLet me double-check the units to make sure I'm not making a mistake.\n\nThe area is in square feet, which is feet squared, and the length is in feet. When I divide area by length, I should get width in feet.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of units:\n\n(square feet) / feet = feet.\n\nBecause square feet is feet times feet, so when you divide by feet, you're left with feet.\n\nSo, the units check out.\n\nNow, is there another way to approach this problem to confirm my answer?\n\nMaybe I can use the formula for the area of a rectangle again, but this time plug in the values I have and see if they make sense.\n\nSo, if length is 7 feet and width is 2 feet, then area should be 7 \u00d7 2 = 14 square feet.\n\nThat matches the given area of the carpet needed, which is 14 square feet.\n\nSo, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I had made a mistake in my initial calculation and got a different width, say 3 feet, then the area would be 7 \u00d7 3 = 21 square feet, which doesn't match the given area of 14 square feet.\n\nSo, that would indicate an error.\n\nBut since 7 \u00d7 2 = 14, it matches perfectly.\n\nIs there any other factor I should consider? For example, is there a possibility that the room isn't a rectangle? The problem says it's a room, and typically rooms are rectangular, but maybe it's not.\n\nHowever, given that the problem mentions length and width, it's safe to assume it's a rectangle.\n\nAlso, the problem specifies \"room is 7 feet long,\" and asks for the width, so it's clear that it's a rectangular shape.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there are any units I need to convert. For example, are there inches or meters involved? But in this case, everything is in feet and square feet, so no conversion is needed.\n\nAlright, so I think my answer is correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at this problem.\n\nSuppose I were to visualize the room. It's 7 feet long and some width, and the total area is 14 square feet.\n\nIf I draw a rectangle representing the room, with one side labeled 7 feet and the other side labeled width, then the area would be the product of these two sides.\n\nSo, again, area = length \u00d7 width, which is 7 \u00d7 width = 14.\n\nSolving for width, width = 14 \u00f7 7 = 2 feet.\n\nSame answer as before.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it in terms of proportions.\n\nIf 7 feet corresponds to 14 square feet, then 1 foot would correspond to 14 \u00f7 7 = 2 square feet.\n\nBut since we're dealing with area, which is two-dimensional, this proportion might not directly apply.\n\nWait, actually, that might not be the best way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider that area is additive, so if I have a room that's 7 feet long and I need 14 square feet, then the width must be such that when multiplied by 7, gives 14.\n\nAgain, leading me back to width = 2 feet.\n\nI think I've confirmed it enough from different angles.\n\nSo, the width of Jesse's room is 2 feet.\n\nBut just to be completely sure, let's consider if there's any possibility of a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet's redo the division", "answer": 2, "equiv": false}, {"output": "99", "answer": 99, "equiv": true}, {"output": "24", "answer": 24, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2436", "answer": 2436, "equiv": true}, {"output": "210", "answer": 210, "equiv": true}, {"output": "45", "answer": 45, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1 \\text{ inch}", "answer": 1, "equiv": false}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: \"They decided to hold the party in their backyard.

First, they have 2 sets of tables, and each set has the same number of chairs. The total number of chairs is 12. I need to find out how many chairs are there for each table.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think about what \"sets of tables\" means. If there are 2 sets, and each set has the same number of chairs, then the total number of chairs should be divided by the number of sets to find out how many chairs are in each set.\n\nSo, total chairs are 12, and there are 2 sets. So, 12 divided by 2 would give me the number of chairs per set.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of chairs per set = total chairs / number of sets\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of chairs per set = 12 / 2 = 6\n\nWait, but the question says \"each having the same number of chairs.\" Does that mean each table within a set has the same number of chairs, or that each set has the same total number of chairs?\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"They have 2 sets of tables, each having the same number of chairs. If there are a total of 12 chairs in the backyard.\"\n\nSo, \"each set has the same number of chairs.\" So, both sets together have 12 chairs, and each set has the same number of chairs. So, each set has 12 / 2 = 6 chairs.\n\nBut the question is asking for \"how many chairs are there for each table.\" Now, does \"each table\" mean each individual table within a set, or is \"a set of tables\" a group of tables?\n\nI think there might be some ambiguity here. Let me consider that a \"set of tables\" means a group of tables, and each group has the same number of chairs in total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each table within a set has the same number of chairs.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to assume that each set consists of multiple tables, and each table within a set has the same number of chairs.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how many tables are in each set. It just says \"sets of tables.\"\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let's consider a simpler approach.\n\nIf there are 2 sets, and each set has the same number of chairs, and total chairs are 12, then each set has 6 chairs.\n\nNow, if each set has only one table, then each table would have 6 chairs.\n\nBut the problem mentions \"sets of tables,\" which suggests that each set contains multiple tables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each set is a single table with multiple chairs.\n\nWait, the wording is ambiguous. Let's consider another angle.\n\nSuppose each set is a table, and each table has the same number of chairs. Then, with 2 tables, each would have 12 / 2 = 6 chairs.\n\nBut then again, maybe a set is a group of tables, and each group has the same number of chairs in total.\n\nI think I need to make an assumption here. Perhaps the problem intends that there are 2 sets, and each set has the same number of chairs, and we need to find out how many chairs are in each set.\n\nIf that's the case, then it's straightforward: 12 chairs total divided by 2 sets equals 6 chairs per set.\n\nBut the question is asking for \"how many chairs are there for each table.\" If a set is a table, then each table has 6 chairs.\n\nAlternatively, if a set contains multiple tables, each with the same number of chairs, then I need more information to determine the number of chairs per table.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps \"sets of tables\" means pairs of tables, and each pair has the same number of chairs in total.\n\nIn that case, again, each set would have 6 chairs.\n\nBut I feel like the problem might be expecting a different interpretation.\n\nLet me consider that each set contains multiple tables, and each table within a set has the same number of chairs.\n\nFor example, suppose each set has 2 tables, and each table has 3 chairs. Then, each set would have 6 chairs, and there would be 2 sets \u00d7 6 chairs/set = 12 chairs total.\n\nAlternatively, if each set has 3 tables, each with 2 chairs, then each set would have 6 chairs, and 2 sets would have 12 chairs total.\n\nSee, without knowing how many tables are in each set, I can't determine the number of chairs per", "answer": 6, "equiv": false}, {"output": "22", "answer": 22, "equiv": true}, {"output": "14", "answer": 14, "equiv": true}, {"output": "109", "answer": 109, "equiv": true}, {"output": "146", "answer": 146, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

So, if Steven has 18, then Jake has 18 - 12 = 6 peaches.\n\nBut wait, the problem also says that Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill. So, if Steven has 18, then Jill must have 18 - 8 = 10 peaches.\n\nHmm, but the way the problem is worded, it says \"Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven who has 8 more peaches than Jill.\" So, it's connecting Steven and Jill directly, and Jake through Steven.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Steven has 18 peaches.\n\n- Jake has 12 fewer than Steven: 18 - 12 = 6 peaches.\n\n- Steven has 8 more than Jill: Jill has 18 - 8 = 10 peaches.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many peaches Jill has. So, according to this, Jill has 10 peaches.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that I'm interpreting the wording correctly. The phrase \"Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven who has 8 more peaches than Jill\" can be a bit tricky.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- \"Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven\" -> Jake = Steven - 12.\n\n- \"Steven who has 8 more peaches than Jill\" -> Steven = Jill + 8.\n\nGiven that Steven has 18 peaches, we can substitute:\n\n- From Steven = Jill + 8, so Jill = Steven - 8 = 18 - 8 = 10 peaches.\n\n- Jake = Steven - 12 = 18 - 12 = 6 peaches.\n\nSo, Jill has 10 peaches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the wording is trying to say that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, who in turn has 8 more than Jill. So, the relationships are separate but connected through Steven.\n\nLet me see if there's another way to interpret this.\n\nSuppose we don't know Steven's peaches and want to express everything in terms of Jill's peaches.\n\nLet's denote Jill's peaches as J.\n\nThen, Steven has J + 8 peaches.\n\nAnd Jake has Steven's peaches minus 12, which is (J + 8) - 12 = J - 4 peaches.\n\nBut the problem states that Steven has 18 peaches. So, J + 8 = 18.\n\nSolving for J: J = 18 - 8 = 10 peaches.\n\nSo, Jill has 10 peaches.\n\nWait, but if Jake has J - 4 peaches, and J = 10, then Jake has 10 - 4 = 6 peaches, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to relate Jake and Jill directly, but it doesn't seem so. The problem separately gives relationships involving Steven.\n\nLet me see if there's any other interpretation.\n\nSuppose we consider that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, who himself has 8 more peaches than Jill. So, the relationships are:\n\n- Steven = Jill + 8\n\n- Jake = Steven - 12\n\nGiven Steven = 18, then Jill = 18 - 8 = 10, and Jake = 18 - 12 = 6.\n\nAlternatively, expressing Jake in terms of Jill:\n\nJake = (Jill + 8) - 12 = Jill - 4.\n\nSo, Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Jill.\n\nBut we don't need to find Jake's peaches; the question is about Jill's peaches.\n\nGiven that Steven has 18 peaches and he has 8 more than Jill, Jill must have 18 - 8 = 10 peaches.\n\nI think that's clear.\n\nWait, maybe the confusion is in the wording: \"Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven who has 8 more peaches than Jill.\"\n\nThis could be interpreted as:\n\nJake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, and Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill.\n\nWhich is what I've done.\n\nAlternatively, someone might misread it as Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven who has 8 more peaches than Jill, somehow thinking that Jake has 12 fewer than Steven's 8 more than Jill, but that would be unclear and", "answer": 10, "equiv": false}, {"output": "99", "answer": 99, "equiv": true}, {"output": "9", "answer": 9, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Okay, so I've got this word problem here.

If he picked 137 tomatoes, how many tomatoes are left?\" Alright, so the farmer has some tomatoes, he picks some, and I need to find out how many are left.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total number of tomatoes the farmer had initially. He had 105 green tomatoes and 71 red tomatoes. So, the total number of tomatoes before picking would be the sum of these two amounts. Let me add those together:\n\n105 + 71\n\nLet's see, 100 plus 70 is 170, and 5 plus 1 is 6, so 170 plus 6 is 176. So, the farmer had 176 tomatoes in total initially.\n\nNext, the farmer picked 137 tomatoes. To find out how many are left, I need to subtract the number of tomatoes picked from the initial total.

Maybe I can think of it as 176 minus 130, which is 46, and then subtract the remaining 7: 46 minus 7 is 39.\n\nAlternatively, I can do it step by step:\n\nStart with 176.\n\nSubtract 100: 176 - 100 = 76.\n\nSubtract 30: 76 - 30 = 46.\n\nSubtract 7: 46 - 7 = 39.\n\nSo, according to this, there are 39 tomatoes left.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. Maybe I'll use a different method to confirm.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the number of green and red tomatoes separately after picking, but that might be more complicated. Or, maybe I can add the number picked to the remaining tomatoes to see if it sums up to the initial total.\n\nLet me verify: if there are 39 tomatoes left, and he picked 137, then 39 + 137 should equal the initial total of 176.\n\nLet's add 39 and 137:\n\n39 + 137.\n\n39 plus 100 is 139, plus 30 is 169, plus 7 is 176. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of equations. Let\u2019s denote the number of tomatoes left as x.\n\nSo, initial tomatoes - picked tomatoes = remaining tomatoes.\n\nThat is, 176 - 137 = x.\n\nWe already calculated x to be 39, and the check confirms it.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let's consider another approach. Maybe using the individual counts of green and red tomatoes.\n\nHe had 105 green and 71 red, totaling 176.\n\nHe picked 137 tomatoes. These could be a combination of green and red tomatoes.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how many of each color he picked, so I probably can't determine separately how many green and red he picked.\n\nBut I don't need to, because the question is just asking for the total number left, regardless of color.\n\nSo, my initial approach of subtracting the total picked from the total initial should be sufficient, and I've already verified it.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that the farmer picked 137 tomatoes from a total of 176, so the remaining should be 176 - 137 = 39.\n\nI can also consider the difference between the numbers. 176 minus 137.\n\nLet me do the subtraction again:\n\n176\n\n-137\n\n---\n\nStarting from the units place: 6 minus 7. 6 is less than 7, so I need to borrow from the tens place. The tens place is 7, borrow 1, so it becomes 6, and the units place becomes 16.\n\n16 minus 7 is 9.\n\nNext, the tens place: 6 minus 3 is 3.\n\nFinally, the hundreds place: 1 minus 1 is 0.\n\nSo, 039, which is 39.\n\nSame result again. Seems consistent.\n\nI think I've confirmed enough that the answer is indeed 39", "answer": 39, "equiv": false}, {"output": "3834", "answer": 3834, "equiv": true}, {"output": "265", "answer": 265, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Matthew started with 31 crackers. After giving some to his 5 friends equally, he has 23 crackers left. I need to find out how many crackers he gave to each friend.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many crackers Matthew gave away in total. He had 31 and now has 23 left, so the difference must be the total number of crackers he gave to his friends. Let me subtract 23 from 31 to find that out.\n\n31 - 23 = 8\n\nSo, Matthew gave away 8 crackers in total.\n\nNow, he gave these 8 crackers to his 5 friends equally. That means each friend got the same number of crackers. To find out how many each friend got, I need to divide the total number of crackers given away by the number of friends.\n\nSo, 8 divided by 5.\n\nBut 8 divided by 5 is 1.6. Wait, crackers are whole items, isn't it? How can you give 1.6 crackers to each friend? Maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me double-check my subtraction. 31 minus 23 is indeed 8.\n\nAnd he has 5 friends. So, 8 divided by 5 is 1.6. Maybe the problem expects the answer in fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means he gave away a certain number of crackers to each friend, but there were some left over?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. Maybe he gave each friend a certain whole number of crackers, and some crackers were left over.\n\nLet me consider that he gave each friend x crackers, and since he has 5 friends, he gave away 5x crackers in total.\n\nAnd after giving away 5x crackers, he has 23 left, which means:\n\nInitial crackers - given away crackers = crackers left\n\nSo, 31 - 5x = 23\n\nNow, I can solve for x.\n\nSubtract 23 from both sides:\n\n31 - 23 - 5x = 0\n\n8 - 5x = 0\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me rearrange.\n\nActually, it's better to isolate x.\n\nStarting from:\n\n31 - 5x = 23\n\nSubtract 23 from both sides:\n\n31 - 23 = 5x\n\n8 = 5x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 5:\n\nx = 8 / 5\n\nx = 1.6\n\nAgain, I get 1.6 crackers per friend. But crackers are typically whole items, so maybe the problem allows for partial crackers, or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that Matthew gave away some whole number of crackers to each friend, and there were some left over, but the problem says he gave equal numbers to his 5 friends, and he has 23 left.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the total given away is divisible by 5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the total number of crackers given away, not per friend.\n\nLet me check the problem again: \"how many crackers did Matthew give to his friends?\"\n\nIt asks for the total number of crackers given to his friends, not per friend.\n\nIn that case, I already found that he gave away 8 crackers in total.\n\nSo, the answer should be 8 crackers.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"he gave equal numbers to his 5 friends,\" which implies he gave a certain number to each friend equally, but the total given away is 8, which doesn't divide evenly by 5.\n\nThis suggests there might be an error in the problem setup or perhaps the crackers were broken into pieces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of how many per friend, which is 1.6 crackers per friend.\n\nBut since crackers are typically whole, maybe it's better to think of it as each friend getting 1 cracker, and there are some left over.\n\nWait, but 5 friends getting 1 cracker each would be 5 crackers given away, and he would have 26 left, which doesn't match the problem.\n\nAlternatively, if each friend gets 1 cracker, that's 5 crackers, and he has 26 left, but the problem says he has 23 left, which doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, if each friend gets 2 crackers, that's 10 crackers given away, and he would have 21 left, which is still not 23.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find out how many crackers each friend got, accepting that it's a fraction.\n\nIn that case, each friend got 1.6 crackers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the total given away, which is 8 crackers.\n\n", "answer": 8, "equiv": false}, {"output": "72", "answer": 72, "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": 6, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "41", "answer": 41, "equiv": true}, {"output": "8", "answer": 8, "equiv": true}, {"output": "39", "answer": 39, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "10", "answer": 10, "equiv": true}, {"output": "44", "answer": 44, "equiv": true}, {"output": "12", "answer": 12, "equiv": true}, {"output": "45", "answer": 45, "equiv": true}, {"output": "208", "answer": 208, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I have this math problem here.

He started with 177 tomatoes and picked 53 of them. So, to find out how many tomatoes are left, I should subtract 53 from 177.\n\nLet me do that calculation:\n\n177 minus 53.\n\n177 - 53.\n\nLet's see, 77 minus 53 is 24, and 100 minus 0 is 100, so 100 + 24 is 124.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that.\n\nActually, 177 - 53:\n\nStarting from the units place: 7 - 3 is 4.\n\nThen, tens place: 7 - 5 is 2.\n\nHundreds place: 1 - 0 is 1.\n\nSo, it should be 124 tomatoes left.\n\nWait, but 177 - 50 is 127, and then -3 is 124. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the potatoes. He had 12 potatoes, and the problem doesn't say he picked any potatoes, only tomatoes. So, the number of potatoes should stay the same, which is 12.\n\nSo, together, he has 124 tomatoes and 12 potatoes left.\n\nBut the problem might be asking for the total number of vegetables left, not each separately.\n\nLet me check the problem again.\n\n\"It picked 53 tomatoes. How many tomatoes and potatoes does he have left?\"\n\nIt says \"how many tomatoes and potatoes does he have left?\" So, it might be asking for both separately, or maybe the total.\n\nTo be safe, I'll calculate both.\n\nFirst, tomatoes left: 177 - 53 = 124.\n\nPotatoes left: 12 (since none were picked).\n\nNow, total vegetables left: 124 + 12 = 136.\n\nBut maybe it's asking for the number of each type left, not the total.\n\nLet me read the problem again carefully.\n\n\"A farmer had 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden.

So, Matthew started with 24 crackers. He gave some to his 3 friends equally, and after that, he had 17 crackers left. I need to find out how many crackers he gave to his friends in total.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many crackers Matthew gave away in total. He started with 24 and had 17 left, so the difference between those two numbers should be the total number of crackers he gave to his friends.\n\nSo, 24 minus 17 is 7. That means he gave away 7 crackers in total.\n\nNow, he gave these 7 crackers to his 3 friends equally. So, to find out how many crackers each friend got, I need to divide the total number of crackers given away by the number of friends.\n\nSo, 7 divided by 3. But 7 divided by 3 is 2 with a remainder of 1, because 3 times 2 is 6, and 7 minus 6 is 1.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. If he gave an equal number to each friend, and there's a remainder, that means he couldn't divide them equally. But the problem says he gave them equally.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with 24 crackers, gave some to 3 friends equally, and had 17 left. So, the total given away is 24 - 17 = 7 crackers.\n\nNow, dividing 7 by 3, it's not a whole number. So, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the total number given away, which is 7, and not necessarily how many each friend got.\n\nBut the problem says \"gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends,\" which implies that the number given to each friend is the same whole number.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Maybe Matthew gave a certain number of crackers to each friend, and after giving that number, he had 17 left.\n\nLet me try to set up an equation for this.\n\nLet\u2019s say each friend received x crackers. Since there are 3 friends, the total given away is 3x.\n\nMatthew started with 24 crackers, gave away 3x, and had 17 left.\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n24 - 3x = 17\n\nNow, I can solve for x.\n\nSubtract 17 from both sides:\n\n24 - 17 - 3x = 17 - 17\n\n7 - 3x = 0\n\nNow, add 3x to both sides:\n\n7 = 3x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 3:\n\nx = 7 / 3\n\nx = 2 and 1/3\n\nWait, but crackers are whole items; you can't give a third of a cracker in most real-world scenarios. Maybe the problem allows for fractional crackers, or perhaps I'm still missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the total number of crackers given away, not per friend.\n\nLooking back, the problem says, \"Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends and still had 17 crackers left. How many crackers did Matthew give to his friends?\"\n\nIt says \"how many crackers did Matthew give to his friends?\" without specifying per friend, so maybe it's asking for the total number given away.\n\nIn that case, as I calculated earlier, 24 - 17 = 7 crackers given away in total.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried to divide 7 by 3, it didn't result in a whole number, which might suggest that the problem envisions fractional crackers or that I've made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the total given away, which is 7, and it's acceptable to have a fraction per friend.\n\nBut since the problem mentions giving \"equal numbers of crackers\" to his friends, it might imply whole crackers.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that crackers can be split into fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nLet me consider another way.\n\nIf Matthew had 24 crackers, gave some to his 3 friends equally, and had 17 left, then the difference is 7, as I calculated.\n\nBut 7 divided by 3 is not a whole number, which suggests that either the problem allows for fractional crackers or perhaps there's a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the number each friend received, and it's okay to have a fraction.\n\nSo, if each friend received 2 and 1/3 crackers, and there are 3 friends, then total given away is 7 crackers, which matches the difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the total given away, which is 7 crackers.\n\nBut the problem says", "answer": 7, "equiv": false}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

The grasshopper jumped 21 inches. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog.

Maybe it's expecting me to calculate the average daily visitors based on these three days and then multiply by 89 days.\n\nLet me think about that. If I take the total visitors over these three days and divide by three, that gives me the average per day. Then, multiplying that average by 89 would give me an estimated total for 89 days.\n\nSo, first, sum the visitors for the three days: 512 + 471 + 808.\n\nLet's add those up: 512 plus 471 is 983, plus 808 is 1791.\n\nSo, total visitors over three days is 1791.\n\nNow, average per day is 1791 divided by 3, which is 597 visitors per day.\n\nThen, for 89 days, it would be 597 multiplied by 89.\n\nBut, 597 times 89... that might be a bit tricky to calculate mentally. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the problem is simply that the palace had 512 visitors on one day, 471 on the previous day, and 808 on the day before that, and that's all that's relevant for the past 89 days. Maybe the past 89 days include only these three days, but that doesn't make much sense because 89 days is more than three days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is saying that these three days are part of the 89 days, and I need to account for the remaining days with some assumption, like zero visitors or average visitors.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should just assume that the total visitors for the past 89 days are the sum of these three days, and the rest of the days had no visitors, though that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about cumulative visitors, but it's not specified.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the problem again.\n\n\"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 512 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 471 visitors the previous day and 808 visitors the day before that. How many visited the Buckingham palace within the past 89 days?\"\n\nSo, it mentions three specific days and their visitor counts, and then asks for the total visitors in the past 89 days.\n\nIf we consider \"that day\" to be day 1, \"the previous day\" as day 2, and \"the day before that\" as day 3, then we have visitor counts for three consecutive days.\n\nBut 89 days is a longer period, so probably, the problem expects me to assume that the visitor numbers for the remaining days are not provided, or perhaps to assume a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is stating that only on these three days there were visitors, and the rest of the 86 days had no visitors.\n\nBut that seems like a strange assumption. Probably, Buckingham Palace has visitors every day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to trick me by providing visitor numbers for three days and then asking for the total over 89 days, implying that the total is just the sum of these three days.\n\nBut that doesn't make much sense because 89 days is much longer than three days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"that day\" refers to one specific day within the 89-day period, and the previous two days are within that period as well.\n\nBut still, without information about the other days, it's hard to determine the total.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects me to calculate the average visitors per day based on these three days and then estimate the total for 89 days.\n\nThat seems like a reasonable approach in the absence of other information.\n\nSo, as I did earlier, sum the visitors for the three days: 512 + 471 + 80", "answer": 1791, "equiv": false}, {"output": "19", "answer": 19, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3021", "answer": 3021, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this math problem step by step. So, we have a story about Paul and his books. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nPaul started with 2 books. That's our starting point. Then, he sold some books in a garage sale. Selling means he gave away some books in exchange for money, right? So, he had 2 books, sold some, and then bought 150 new ones. After all that, he has 58 books now.\n\nOkay, so we need to find out how many books he sold. Let's think about this logically.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of books he sold as \\( x \\). So, he sold \\( x \\) books.\n\nStarting with 2 books, after selling \\( x \\) books, he would have \\( 2 - x \\) books left.\n\nThen, he bought 150 new books. So, he adds 150 books to the remaining books he had after the sale. That means he had \\( (2 - x) + 150 \\) books after buying the new ones.\n\nAccording to the problem, after all these transactions, he has 58 books. So, we can set up an equation:\n\n\\[ (2 - x) + 150 = 58 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( x \\).\n\nFirst, simplify the left side:\n\n\\[ 2 - x + 150 = 58 \\]\n\n\\[ 152 - x = 58 \\]\n\nNow, we want to isolate \\( x \\). Let's subtract 58 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 152 - x - 58 = 58 - 58 \\]\n\n\\[ 94 - x = 0 \\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my steps.\n\nActually, from \\( 152 - x = 58 \\), we can subtract 58 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 152 - x - 58 = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 94 - x = 0 \\]\n\nThen, to solve for \\( x \\), we can add \\( x \\) to both sides:\n\n\\[ 94 - x + x = 0 + x \\]\n\n\\[ 94 = x \\]\n\nSo, \\( x = 94 \\).\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't make sense. If Paul started with 2 books, sold 94 books, he would have \\( 2 - 94 = -92 \\) books, which is not possible. You can't have negative books. So, maybe I did something wrong.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nStarting with 2 books, sold \\( x \\) books, so he has \\( 2 - x \\) books left.\n\nThen, he bought 150 new books, so he has \\( 2 - x + 150 \\) books.\n\nAccording to the problem, now he has 58 books:\n\n\\[ 2 - x + 150 = 58 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 152 - x = 58 \\]\n\nNow, subtract 152 from both sides:\n\n\\[ -x = 58 - 152 \\]\n\n\\[ -x = -94 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\\[ x = 94 \\]\n\nAgain, I get \\( x = 94 \\). But that can't be right because he started with only 2 books. He can't sell more books than he has.\n\nUnless... maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again: \"Paul had 2 books. After selling some in a garage sale he bought 150 new ones. If he has 58 books now. How many books did he sell?\"\n\nWait a second, the way it's phrased is a bit tricky. It says \"after selling some in a garage sale he bought 150 new ones.\" Does that mean he sold some books and then bought 150 new ones, or that after selling some books in the garage sale, he bought 150 new ones with the money he got from selling?\n\nActually, the wording is a bit ambiguous, but I think it's the first interpretation: he sold some books, then bought 150 new ones.\n\nBut still, if he started with 2 books and sold some, how can he end up with 58 after buying 150 more?\n\nLet me try plugging in \\( x = 94 \\) again.\n\nStart with 2 books, sell 94 books: \\( 2 - 94 = -92 \\) books. Then buy 150 books: \\( -92 + 150 = 58 \\) books.

So, we have some information about visitors to Buckingham Palace. Today, 132 visitors came. And over the past 327 days, including today, a total of 406 people visited.

We have the total visitors over 327 days, which includes today, and we know today's visitor count. We need to find yesterday's visitor count.\n\nLet me think about this. If 327 days include today, then yesterday would be one of those 327 days, right? So, the total visitors over 327 days is 406.\n\nWait a minute, that seems too low. 327 days with a total of 406 visitors? That averages to less than 2 visitors per day, which seems too low for Buckingham Palace. But maybe it's a typo, or perhaps it's a different context. I'll proceed with the numbers given.\n\nSo, total visitors in 327 days: 406 visitors.\n\nVisitors today: 132 visitors.\n\nWe need to find the number of visitors yesterday.\n\nFirst, let's find out the total visitors in the 326 days before today. Since the 327 days include today, we can subtract today's visitors from the total to get the visitors for the previous 326 days.\n\nTotal visitors in 326 days = Total visitors in 327 days - today's visitors\n\nSo,\n\n326 days visitors = 406 - 132\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n406 minus 132 is... 406 - 100 = 306, then 306 - 30 = 276, and 276 - 2 = 274.\n\nSo, 274 visitors in 326 days.\n\nNow, we need to find yesterday's visitors. But wait, the question is a bit confusing. It says \"within the past 327 days,\" including today, and we need to find the number of visitors on the previous day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"within the past 327 days\" means the last 327 days, excluding today. If that's the case, then the total of 406 visitors is for the past 327 days, not including today. So, today would be an additional day.\n\nLet me check the problem again.\n\n\"Within the past 327 days, 406 people visited Buckingham Palace.\"\n\nThen, \"today, 132 visitors came.\"\n\nSo, if \"within the past 327 days\" means the last 327 days excluding today, then the total visitors in those 327 days is 406, and today is an additional day with 132 visitors.\n\nIn this case, yesterday would be included in those 327 days.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"within the past 327 days,\" and then mentions that on the day they visited (today), 132 visitors came.\n\nI think there might be some ambiguity here.\n\nLet me re-read the problem:\n\n\"After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace.

How many bags of cookies do you have?\" Okay, let's try to solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It says that each bag contains 3 cookies, and I have a total of 21 cookies. I need to find out how many bags that would make. So, basically, I need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per bag.\n\nSo, the total number of cookies is 21, and each bag has 3 cookies. So, the number of bags would be 21 divided by 3. Let me write that down:\n\nNumber of bags = Total cookies / Cookies per bag\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of bags = 21 / 3\n\nNow, 21 divided by 3 is 7. So, I have 7 bags. But let me make sure that makes sense. If each bag has 3 cookies, and I have 7 bags, then total cookies would be 3 times 7, which is 21. That matches the total number of cookies I have. So, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nWait a minute, the problem says \"you had 21 cookies in total.\" The past tense is used here. Does that mean that some cookies have been consumed or something? Wait, no, it's just a way of stating the total number of cookies you have. It doesn't necessarily imply that cookies have been eaten or anything; it's just indicating the total amount.\n\nSo, no, I don't think I need to consider any cookies being eaten or anything like that. It's just a straightforward division problem.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using multiplication. If each bag has 3 cookies, and I have 7 bags, then 3 times 7 is 21. That checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about it in terms of subtraction. If I keep taking out bags of 3 cookies each time, how many times can I do that before I run out of cookies. So, starting with 21 cookies:\n\nFirst bag: 21 - 3 = 18\n\nSecond bag: 18 - 3 = 15\n\nThird bag: 15 - 3 = 12\n\nFourth bag: 12 - 3 = 9\n\nFifth bag: 9 - 3 = 6\n\nSixth bag: 6 - 3 = 3\n\nSeventh bag: 3 - 3 = 0\n\nSo, I can make 7 bags before I run out of cookies. Again, that gives me 7 bags.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to use the concept of division as the inverse of multiplication. If I know that number of bags times cookies per bag equals total cookies, then number of bags equals total cookies divided by cookies per bag. Which again brings me back to 21 divided by 3 equals 7.\n\nI could also consider using units to make sure that makes sense. If each bag has 3 cookies, and I have 21 cookies, then the number of bags would be 21 cookies divided by 3 cookies per bag, which gives me 7 bags. The units work out correctly because cookies divided by cookies per bag gives me the number of bags.\n\nLet me consider if there's any other factor I should be considering. Is there any possibility that the bags could have different numbers of cookies, or are there any constraints I'm not aware of? The problem says each bag has 3 cookies, so I can assume that all bags have exactly 3 cookies each.\n\nAlso, it says \"you had 21 cookies in total.\" Does that mean that all cookies are placed into bags, or could there be some left over? Well, since 21 is perfectly divisible by 3, there shouldn't be any cookies left over.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify that all cookies are placed into bags. It just says \"you had 21 cookies in total.\" Maybe some cookies are not placed into bags. But based on the way the problem is worded, it seems like all cookies are placed into bags of 3 each.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is trying to ask how many bags can be filled with 21 cookies if each bag holds 3 cookies. In that case, again, it's 21 divided by 3, which is 7.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether there could be fractional bags. But since we're dealing with whole bags and whole cookies, it's reasonable to assume that we're only dealing with whole numbers of bags.\n\nSo, in conclusion, I have 7 bags of cookies.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"you had 21 cookies in total.\" Does that mean that I had them", "answer": 7, "equiv": false}, {"output": "8", "answer": 8, "equiv": true}, {"output": "15", "answer": 15, "equiv": true}, {"output": "92", "answer": 92, "equiv": true}, {"output": "6264", "answer": 6264, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

So, today is day 86.\n\nIf the past 85 days had 829 visitors, and the previous day had 45 visitors, then the number of visitors in the 85 days is 829, including the previous day's 45 visitors.\n\nSo, the total visitors in 85 days: 829\n\nVisitors on previous day: 45\n\nSo, the visitors in the first 84 days would be 829 - 45 = 784.\n\nNow, if today is day 86, and we need to find the number of visitors on that day, but we don't have information about day 86.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nPerhaps the problem is: the total visitors in the last 85 days is 829, and on the previous day there were 45 visitors, and we need to find the number of visitors on today, which is day 86.\n\nIf that's the case, then the number of visitors on day 86 is not provided, and we can't determine it from the given information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"that day\" refers to one of the days in the past 85 days.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the problem:\n\n- In the past 85 days, there were a total of 829 visitors.\n\n- On the previous day (day 86), there were 45 visitors.\n\n- We need to find the number of visitors on \"that day,\" which might be a specific day within the past 85 days.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to determine which day is being referred to.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about finding the average number of visitors per day in the past 85 days, and then using that to estimate the number of visitors on the previous day or another day.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right, because the total is given, and the previous day's visitors are also given.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is about the distribution of visitors over the 85 days, but again, without more information, that's impossible to determine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"that day\" refers to a specific day within the 85 days, and we need to find the number of visitors on that particular day.\n\nBut without knowing more about that day or its relation to the others, it's impossible to determine the number of visitors.\n\nI think there might be", "answer": 784, "equiv": false}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1", "answer": 1, "equiv": true}, {"output": "38", "answer": 38, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "So I've got this problem here: There are 4502 Skittles and 4276 erasers in Steven's collection.

It seems like all the Skittles and erasers are divided into 154 groups, and I need to find out how many items are in each group. But wait, are the groups made up of both Skittles and erasers mixed, or are they separate?\n\nThe problem says \"the skittles and erasers are organized into 154 groups.\" It doesn't specify if the groups contain both Skittles and erasers or just one type. However, since it mentions both, I think the groups likely contain both Skittles and erasers.\n\nSo, maybe each group has a certain number of Skittles and a certain number of erasers. But the question is asking for the size of each group, which I interpret as the total number of items (Skittles plus erasers) in each group.\n\nAlright, so the total number of Skittles is 4502, and the total number of erasers is 4276. So, the total number of items is 4502 plus 4276.\n\nLet me calculate that: 4500 + 4200 = 8700, and 02 + 76 = 78, so 8700 + 78 = 8778 items in total.\n\nNow, these 8778 items are divided into 154 groups. To find out how many items are in each group, I need to divide the total number of items by the number of groups.\n\nSo, 8778 divided by 154.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit rusty on division, but let's try.\n\nFirst, I'll see how many times 154 goes into 877.\n\n154 times 5 is 770.\n\nSubtract that from 877: 877 - 770 = 107.\n\nThen, bring down the next digit, which is 8, making it 1078.\n\nNow, how many times does 154 go into 1078?\n\nLet's see, 154 times 7 is 1078 exactly.\n\nSo, 154 times 57 is 8778.\n\nWait, let me check: 154 times 50 is 7700, and 154 times 7 is 1078, so 7700 + 1078 is 8778. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, each group has 57 items.\n\nWait a minute, but the problem might be expecting something else. Maybe the groups have the same number of Skittles and the same number of erasers.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each group has the same number of Skittles and the same number of erasers, and I need to find out how many Skittles and how many erasers per group.\n\nBut the question says \"how big is each group,\" which probably means the total number of items per group, which is what I just calculated: 57 items per group.\n\nBut maybe it's expecting the number of Skittles and erasers separately.\n\nLet me check.\n\nIf there are 154 groups, and 4502 Skittles, then Skittles per group would be 4502 divided by 154.\n\nSimilarly, erasers per group would be 4276 divided by 154.\n\nBut the question is asking for the size of each group, which should be the sum of Skittles and erasers per group.\n\nWait, no. If I calculate Skittles per group and erasers per group separately and then add them, it should give me the total items per group, which is what I did earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to divide the totals separately and then add.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, Skittles per group: 4502 divided by 154.\n\nLet's see, 154 times 29 is 154 times 20 is 3080, and 154 times 9 is 1386, so 3080 + 1386 = 4466.\n\nSubtract that from 4502: 4502 - 4466 = 36.\n\nSo, 29 groups of 154 Skittles", "answer": 57, "equiv": false}, {"output": "1088", "answer": 1088, "equiv": true}, {"output": "32", "answer": 32, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "4", "answer": 4, "equiv": true}, {"output": "34", "answer": 34, "equiv": true}, {"output": "41", "answer": 41, "equiv": true}, {"output": "25", "answer": 25, "equiv": true}, {"output": "7", "answer": 7, "equiv": true}, {"output": "127", "answer": 127, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "23", "answer": 23, "equiv": true}, {"output": "1396", "answer": 1396, "equiv": true}, {"output": "2", "answer": 2, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step.

So, $967 per week.\n\nNow, the harvest season lasts for 1091 weeks. So, to find out the total earnings over the entire season, I need to multiply his weekly earnings by the number of weeks.\n\nTotal earnings = total weekly earnings \u00d7 number of weeks\n               = $967 \u00d7 1091\n\nHmm, multiplying 967 by 1091. That seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can break it down to make it easier.\n\nI know that 1091 is the same as 1000 + 90 + 1. So, I can multiply 967 by each of these and then add them up.\n\nFirst, 967 \u00d7 1000 = 967,000\n\nNext, 967 \u00d7 90. Well, 967 \u00d7 90 is the same as 967 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 10.\n\n967 \u00d7 9: 900 \u00d7 9 = 8100, 67 \u00d7 9 = 603, so 8100 + 603 = 8,703\n\nThen, multiply by 10: 8,703 \u00d7 10 = 87,030\n\nSo, 967 \u00d7 90 = 87,030\n\nNow, 967 \u00d7 1 = 967\n\nNow, add them all up: 967,000 + 87,030 + 967\n\nFirst, add 967,000 and 87,030: 967,000 + 87,030 = 1,054,030\n\nThen, add 967: 1,054,030 + 967 = 1,055, (let's see) 030 + 967.\n\n030 + 967 is 997, so it's 1,054,997.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that addition again.\n\n967,000 + 87,030 = 1,054,030\n\nThen, 1,054,030 + 967.\n\nLet's add 1,054,000 + 967 = 1,054,967\n\nPlus the 30: 1,054,967 + 30 = 1,055,000 - 3 (since 967 + 30 is 997, which is 1,000 - 3).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should just add them directly.\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n7 + 0 = 7\n\n3 + 3 = 6\n\n0 + 0 = 0\n\n4 + 7 = 11, so write 1 and carry over 1\n\n0 + 8 + 1 = 9\n\n5 + 0 = 5\n\n0 + 6 = 6\n\n1 + 0 = 1\n\nSo, it's 1,055,000 - 3 = 1,054,997.\n\nWait, but directly adding 1,054,030 + 967:\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n0 + 7 = 7\n\n3 + 6 = 9\n\n0 + 9 = 9\n\n4 + 0 = 4\n\n5 + 5 = 0, carry over 1\n\n0 + 1 + 0 = 1\n\nSo, it", "answer": 1054997, "equiv": false}, {"output": "6", "answer": 8, "equiv": false}, {"output": "6", "answer": 6, "equiv": true}, {"output": "5", "answer": 5, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Melissa scored 109 points in each game and also got 82 bonus points in each game. I need to find out how many points she scored in total over 79 games. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. Melissa has points from regular scoring and bonus points in each game. So, in each game, her total points would be the sum of her regular points and her bonus points. Then, to find out the total over 79 games, I'll need to multiply that combined points per game by the number of games.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal points per game = regular points per game + bonus points per game\n\nTotal points in 79 games = (regular points per game + bonus points per game) \u00d7 number of games\n\nNow, plugging in the numbers:\n\nRegular points per game = 109\n\nBonus points per game = 82\n\nNumber of games = 79\n\nSo, total points per game = 109 + 82\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n109 + 82 = 191\n\nSo, Melissa scores 191 points in each game when you include the bonus points.\n\nNow, to find the total points over 79 games, I need to multiply 191 by 79.\n\nTotal points = 191 \u00d7 79\n\nI should probably do this multiplication step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nFirst, let's multiply 191 by 9 (since 79 is 70 + 9):\n\n191 \u00d7 9 = ?\n\nWell, 190 \u00d7 9 = 1710\n\nAnd 1 \u00d7 9 = 9\n\nSo, 1710 + 9 = 1719\n\nThat's the first part.\n\nNext, multiply 191 by 70:\n\n191 \u00d7 70 = ?\n\nWell, 191 \u00d7 7 = 1337\n\nThen, 1337 \u00d7 10 = 13370\n\nSo, 191 \u00d7 70 = 13,370\n\nNow, add the two parts together:\n\n1719 (from 191 \u00d7 9) + 13,370 (from 191 \u00d7 70) = ?\n\nLet's add them up:\n\n1719\n\n+13,370\n\n------\n\n15,089\n\nSo, Melissa scored a total of 15,089 points in 79 games.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, confirm the addition of 1719 and 13,370:\n\n1719\n\n+13,370\n\n------\n\nStarting from the right:\n\n9 + 0 = 9\n\n1 + 7 = 8\n\n7 + 3 = 10, carry over 1\n\n3 + 3 + 1 (carried over) = 7\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nSo, it should be 15,089.\n\nAlright, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could multiply 191 by 79 directly.\n\nLet me try that to confirm.\n\n191 \u00d7 79\n\nFirst, multiply 191 by 9:\n\n191 \u00d7 9 = 1,719\n\nThen, multiply 191 by 70:\n\n191 \u00d7 70 = 13,370\n\nNow, add them together:\n\n1,719 + 13,370 = 15,089\n\nSame result. Good.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the standard multiplication algorithm:\n\n      191\n\n    \u00d7  79\n\n    -------\n\n     1719   (191 \u00d7 9)\n\n   13370    (191 \u00d7 70, note the zero placeholder)\n\n  -------\n\n   15089\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, the total points Melissa scored in 79 games is 15,089.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's another way to look at the problem.\n\nWait a second, the problem says Melissa scored 109 points in each game and got 82 bonus points in each game. So, per game, it's 109 + 82 = 191 points, and then multiplied by 79 games.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as:\n\nTotal points = (regular points per game \u00d7 number of games) + (bonus points per game \u00d7", "answer": 15089, "equiv": false}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "81", "answer": 81, "equiv": true}, {"output": "626", "answer": 626, "equiv": true}, {"output": "6", "answer": 6, "equiv": true}, {"output": "42", "answer": 42, "equiv": true}, {"output": "331", "answer": 331, "equiv": true}, {"output": "3", "answer": 3, "equiv": true}, {"output": "56", "answer": 56, "equiv": true}, {"output": "Let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Paige and her mom planted 55 seeds together. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed, and in each flower bed, only 60 seeds grew into flowers. Hmm, that seems a bit off because they only planted 15 seeds per bed, but it's saying 60 grew into flowers. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many flower beds they have. They planted 55 seeds, putting 15 seeds in each bed. So, the number of flower beds would be 55 divided by 15. Let me do that calculation:\n\n55 \u00f7 15 = 3.666...\n\nOh, that doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a flower bed. Maybe they have 3 full flower beds and some leftover seeds. Let's see:\n\n15 seeds per bed \u00d7 3 beds = 45 seeds\n\nSo, 55 - 45 = 10 seeds left over. Maybe they put these 10 seeds in an additional bed, but then it's not 15 seeds per bed. Maybe the problem assumes that they only have 3 flower beds with 15 seeds each, and 10 seeds elsewhere that aren't considered in the flower beds. But the problem says they planted 55 seeds together, putting 15 in each flower bed, so perhaps they have 3 full beds and one partial bed.\n\nBut the problem also says that in each flower bed, 60 seeds grew into flowers. Wait, that can't be right because they only put 15 seeds in each bed. How can 60 seeds grow into flowers if only 15 were planted? Maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be 60% of the seeds grew into flowers.\n\nThat would make more sense. So, instead of 60 seeds, it's 60% of the seeds in each bed that grew into flowers.\n\nLet me assume that's the case.\n\nSo, in each flower bed, 60% of the 15 seeds grew into flowers.\n\nFirst, find out how many flowers grew in one bed:\n\n60% of 15 = 0.60 \u00d7 15 = 9 flowers per bed.\n\nNow, they have 3 full flower beds and one partial bed with 10 seeds.\n\nFor the partial bed, again, 60% of the seeds grew into flowers:\n\n60% of 10 = 0.60 \u00d7 10 = 6 flowers.\n\nSo, total flowers would be:\n\n(3 beds \u00d7 9 flowers per bed) + 6 flowers from the partial bed = 27 + 6 = 33 flowers.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider if the partial bed is also considered a flower bed. The problem says they put 15 seeds in each flower bed, but they have 10 seeds left over. Maybe those 10 seeds weren't planted in a flower bed, or maybe it's considered a separate bed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 55 seeds were distributed into flower beds with 15 seeds each, and any remaining seeds are not placed in a flower bed. In that case, only the full flower beds are considered for the growth of flowers.\n\nSo, with 55 seeds and 15 per bed, they have 3 full beds (45 seeds) and 10 seeds left over not in a bed.\n\nThen, only the 3 beds have seeds that grow into flowers, with 60% growth per bed.\n\nSo, 3 beds \u00d7 (15 seeds per bed \u00d7 60%) = 3 \u00d7 9 = 27 flowers.\n\nBut that seems too low compared to the initial interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, if the partial bed is also considered and has the same 60% growth rate:\n\nTotal flowers = (3 beds \u00d7 9 flowers) + (1 bed \u00d7 6 flowers) = 27 + 6 = 33 flowers.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to calculate the total number of seeds that grew into flowers across all beds, including the partial one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that they planted 55 seeds in total, distributing them into beds with 15 seeds each, and in each of those beds, 60 seeds grew into flowers.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because you can't have more flowers than seeds planted in a bed.\n\nUnless they planted multiple layers or something, but that's probably not the case.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about seeds per flower bed and flowers per bed separately.\n\nLet me read the problem again:\n\n\"Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds.
